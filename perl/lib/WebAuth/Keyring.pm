=head1 NAME

WebAuth::Keyring - WebAuth keyring to hold encryption and decryption keys

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebAuth qw(WA_KEY_AES WA_AES_128);
    use WebAuth::Key;
    use WebAuth::Keyring;

    my $wa = WebAuth->new;
    eval {
        $key = WebAuth::Key->new ($wa, WA_KEY_AES, WA_AES_128);
        $ring = WebAuth::Keyring->new ($wa, $key);
        ...
    };
    if ($@) {
        # handle exception
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl class represents a keyring, which is a set of WebAuth keys with
associated creation times and times after which they become valid.  These
keyrings can be read from and stored to files on disk and are used by
WebAuth Application Servers and WebKDCs to store their encryption keys.

A WebAuth::Keyring object will be destroyed when the WebAuth context used
to create it is destroyed, and subsequent accesses to it may cause memory
access errors or other serious bugs.  Be careful not to retain a copy of a
WebAuth::Keyring object after the WebAuth object that created it has been
destroyed.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

As with WebAuth module functions, failures are signaled by throwing
WebAuth::Exception rather than by return status.

=over 4

=item new (WEBAUTH, KEY)

=item new (WEBAUTH, SIZE)

Create a new keyring attached to the WebAuth context WEBAUTH.

The second argument to this method may be either a WebAuth::Key object or
a numeric size.  If a WebAuth::Key object is provided, a new keyring
containing only that key will be created and returned.  If a size is
provided, a new, empty keyring with space preallocated to hold that many
keys is created and returned.  (Regardless of the allocated size of a
keyring, keyrings will always dynamically expand to hold any new keys that
are added to them.)

This is a convenience wrapper around the WebAuth keyring_new() method.

=item read (WEBAUTH, FILE)

Create a new WebAuth::Keyring object by reading its contents from the
provided file.  The created keyring object will have no association with
the file after being created; it won't automatically be saved, or updated
when the file changes.

This is a convenience wrapper around the WebAuth keyring_read() method.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

As with WebAuth module functions, failures are signaled by throwing
WebAuth::Exception rather than by return status.

=over 4

=item add (CREATION, VALID_AFTER, KEY)

Add a new KEY to the keyring with CREATION as the creation time and
VALID_AFTER as the valid-after time.  Both of the times should be in
seconds since epoch.  The key must be a WebAuth::Key object.

Keys will not used for encryption until after their valid-after time,
which provides an opportunity to synchronize the keyring between multiple
systems before the keys are used.

=item best_key (USAGE, HINT)

Returns the best key available in the keyring for a particular purpose and
time.  USAGE should be either WebAuth::WA_KEY_DECRYPT or
WebAuth::WA_KEY_ENCRYPT and indicates whether the key will be used for
decryption or encryption.  For decryption keys, HINT is the timestamp of
the data that will be decrypted.

If USAGE is WebAuth::WA_KEY_ENCRYPT, this method will return the valid key
in the keyring that was created most recently, since this is the best key
to use for encryption going forward.  If USAGE is WebAuth::WA_KEY_DECRYPT
is false, this method will return the key most likely to have been used to
encrypt something at the time HINT, where HINT is given in seconds since
epoch.

=item entries ()

In a scalar context, returns the number of entries in the keyring.  In an
array context, returns a list of keyring entries as WebAuth::KeyringEntry
objects.

=item remove (INDEX)

Removes the INDEX entry in the keyring, where INDEX is a numeric key
number starting from 0.  The keyring will then be compacted, so all
subsequent entries in the keyring will have their index decreased by one.
If you are removing multiple entries from a keyring, you should therefore
remove them from the end of the keyring (the highest INDEX number) first.

=item write (FILE)

Writes the keyring out to FILE in the format suitable for later reading by
read().
