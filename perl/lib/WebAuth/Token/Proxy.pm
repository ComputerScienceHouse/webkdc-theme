=head1 NAME

WebAuth::Token::Proxy - WebAuth proxy tokens

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $token = WebAuth::Token::Proxy->new;
    $token->subject ('user');
    $token->type ('krb5');
    $token->webkdc_proxy ($raw);
    $token->expiration (time + 3600);
    print $token->encode ($keyring), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A WebAuth proxy token, used by a WebAuth Application Server to request
other tokens from the WebKDC.  This is returned by the WebKDC to a WebAuth
Application Server if the WAS may need to request various tokens
(particularly credential tokens).

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new ()

Create a new, empty WebAuth::Token::Proxy.  At least some attributes will
have to be set using the accessor methods described below before the token
can be used.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

As with WebAuth module functions, failures are signaled by throwing
WebAuth::Exception rather than by return status.

=head1 General Methods

=over 4

=item encode (KEYRING)

Generate the encoded and encrypted form of this token using the provided
KEYRING.  The encryption key used will be the one returned by the
best_key() method of WebAuth::Keyring on that KEYRING.

=back

=head1 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item subject ([SUBJECT])

Get or set the subject, which holds the authenticated identity of the user
whose credentials and id tokens can be retrieved using this token.

=item authz_subject ([SUBJECT])

Get or set the authorization subject, which holds the asserted
authorization identity of the user holding this token.  The authorization
identity may not match the authenticated identity.  It represents a
request to use the authorization identity instead of the authentication
subject when applying ACLs or determining identity in the application.

=item type ([TYPE])

Get or set the type of proxy token, which specifies the type of
webkdc-proxy token is included in it.  This is currently always C<krb5>.

=item webkdc_proxy ([DATA])

Get or set the embedded webkdc-proxy token.  This is an opaque blob of
data from the perspective of the WebAuth Application Server.  It is
decrypted and used by the WebKDC to fulfill a token request and consists
of a webkdc-proxy token without the base64 encoding.

=item initial_factors ([FACTORS])

Get or set a comma-separated list of authentication factors used by the
user during initial authentication (the single sign-on transaction).  For
a list of possible factors and their meaning, see the WebAuth protocol
specification.

=item session_factors ([FACTORS])

Get or set a comma-separated list of authentication factors used by the
user to authenticate this session (this particular visit to this WebAuth
Application Server).  For a list of possible factors and their meaning,
see the WebAuth protocol specification.

=item loa ([LOA])

Get or set the level of assurance established for this user
authentication.  This is a number whose values are site-defined but for
which increasing numbers represent increasing assurance for the
authentication.

=item creation ([TIMESTAMP])

Get or set the creation timestamp for this token in seconds since epoch.
If not set, the encoded token will have a creation time set to the time
of encoding.

=item expiration ([TIMESTAMP])

Get or set the expiration timestamp for this token in seconds since epoch.
