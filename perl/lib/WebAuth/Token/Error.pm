=head1 NAME

WebAuth::Token::Error - WebAuth error tokens

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebAuth qw(WA_PEC_LOGIN_CANCELLED);

    my $token = WebAuth::Token::Error->new;
    $token->code (WA_PEC_LOGIN_CANCELLED);
    $token->message ('user canceled login');
    $token_>creation (time);
    print $token->encode ($keyring), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A WebAuth error token, returned by the WebKDC in response to a request
token if some error occurred in processing that request.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new ()

Create a new, empty WebAuth::Token::Error.  At least some attributes will
have to be set using the accessor methods described below before the token
can be used.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

As with WebAuth module functions, failures are signaled by throwing
WebAuth::Exception rather than by return status.

=head1 General Methods

=over 4

=item encode (KEYRING)

Generate the encoded and encrypted form of this token using the provided
KEYRING.  The encryption key used will be the one returned by the
best_key() method of WebAuth::Keyring on that KEYRING.

=back

=head1 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item code ([CODE])

Get or set the error code, which should be one of the WA_PEC_* error
codes exported by the WebAuth module.

=item message ([MESSAGE])

Get or set the error message.

=item creation ([TIMESTAMP])

Get or set the creation timestamp for this token in seconds since epoch.
If not set, the encoded token will have a creation time set to the time
of encoding.
