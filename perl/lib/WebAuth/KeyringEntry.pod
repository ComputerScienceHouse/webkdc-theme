=head1 NAME

WebAuth::KeyringEntry - A single entry in a WebAuth::Keyring

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebAuth ();
    use WebAuth::Keyring ();

    my $wa = WebAuth->new;
    eval {
        $ring = WebAuth::Keyring->read ($wa, '/path/to/keyring');
        my @entries = $ring->entries;
        for my $entry (@entries) {
            print $entry->creation, ' ', $entry->valid_after, "\n";
        }
    };
    if ($@) {
        # handle exception
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A WebAuth::KeyringEntry represents a single entry in a WebAuth::Keyring.
Calling the entries() method on a WebAuth::Keyring in an array context
returns a list of these objects.  They encapsulate the WebAuth::Key and
the additional metadata about that key stored in a keyring, specifically
the creation and valid-after timestamps.

This object is always read-only.

A WebAuth::KeyringEntry object will be destroyed when the corresponding
WebAuth::Keyring object is destroyed, which in turn will happen when the
WebAuth context used to create it is destroyed.  Subsequent accesses to it
may cause memory access errors or other serious bugs.  Be careful not to
retain a copy of a WebAuth::KeyringEntry object after the enclosing
objects that created it have been destroyed.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS
