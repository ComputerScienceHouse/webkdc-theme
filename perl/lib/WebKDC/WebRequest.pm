=head1 NAME

WebKDC::WebRequest - Encapsulates a request to a WebAuth WebKDC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebKDC::WebRequest;

    my $req = WebKDC::WebRequest->new;
    $req->user ($user);
    $req->pass ($password);
    $req->request_token ($RT);
    $req->service_token ($ST);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A WebKDC::WebRequest object encapsulates a request to a WebAuth WebKDC,
representing a login attempt for a particular WebAuth Application Server.
It is used by the WebLogin server as the argument to
make_request_token_request.  The object has very little inherent
functionality.  It's mostly a carrier for data.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new ()

Create a new, empty WebKDC::WebRequest object.  At least some parameters
must be set using accessor functions as described below to do anything
useful with the object.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item authz_subject ([USER])

Retrieve or set the requested authorization identity.  This is an identity
that the user wishes to assert for authorization purposes to the remote
site.  It must be vetted by the WebKDC and will be included in the id or
proxy token if asserting that authorization identity is permitted.

=item local_ip_addr ([ADDR])

=item local_ip_port ([PORT])

=item remote_ip_addr ([ADDR])

=item remote_ip_port ([PORT])

Retrieve or set information about the network connection that is
attempting authentication.  If one of these values is set, all of them
should be set.  The remote_* parameters are the IP address of the remote
client that is attempting to authenticate, and the local_* parameters are
the local interface and port to which that client connected.

=item otp ([CODE])

Retrieve or set the one-time password sent by the user.  Either this or
pass should be set, but not both.

=item pass ([PASSWORD])

Retrieve or set the password sent by the user.  Either this or otp should
be set, but not both.

=item proxy_cookie (TYPE[, COOKIE, FACTOR])

Retrieve or set a proxy cookie of a particular type.  If COOKIE and FACTOR
are given, sets a cookie of the given TYPE with value COOKIE and session
factor FACTOR.  Returns the cookie value of the given TYPE or undef if no
such cookie is available.

=item proxy_cookies ([COOKIES])

Retrieve or set a hash of all cookies.  If the COOKIES parameter is
provided, it must be a hash of cookie types to anonymous hashes, with each
value hash having two keys: C<cookie>, whose value is the cookie value,
and C<session_factor>, whose value is the session factors for that cookie.
Returns a hash of cookie types to values without the factor information.

=item proxy_cookies_rich ([COOKIES])

Retrieve or set a hash of all cookies including session factors.  If the
COOKIES parameter is provided, it must be a hash of cookie types to
anonymous hashes, with each value hash having two keys: C<cookie>, whose
value is the cookie value, and C<session_factor>, whose value is the
session factors for that cookie.  Returns a hash in the same structure as
the COOKIES argument.

=item remote_user ([USER])

Retrieve or set the remote username, as determined by some external
authentication system such as Apache authentication.  This is not
currently used.

=item request_token ([TOKEN])

Retrieve or set the request token from the WebAuth application server that
prompted this authentication request.  This must be set to create a valid
WebKDC::WebRequest.

=item service_token ([TOKEN])

Retrieve or set the service token provided by the WebAuth application
server, which contains the key used to decrypt the request token.  This
must be set to create a valid WebKDC::WebRequest.

=item user ([USER])

Retrieve or set the username of the authenticating user.  This must be set
to create a valid WebKDC::WebRequest.
