WebKDC::WebKDCException - Exceptions for WebKDC communications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebKDC;
    use WebKDC::WebKDCException;

    eval {
        # ...
        WebKDC::request_token_request($req, $resp);
        # ...
    };
    my $e = $@;
    if (ref $e and $e->isa ('WebKDC::WebKDCException')) {
        # you can call the following methods on a WebKDCException object:
        # $e->status()
        # $e->message()
        # $e->error_code()
        # $e->verbose_message()
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Various WebKDC functions may return a WebKDC::WebKDCException object if
anything goes wrong.  This object encapsulates various information about
the error.

This module also defines the status codes returned by the WebKDC
functions.

=head1 CONSTANTS

The following constants are exported:

=over 4

=item WK_SUCCESS

This status code never comes back as part of an exception.  It is returned
for success.

=item WK_ERR_USER_AND_PASS_REQUIRED

This status code indicates that a function was called that required a
username and password. The user should be prompted for their username and
the function should be called again.

=item WK_ERR_LOGIN_FAILED

This status code indicates that a function was called that attempted to
validate the username and password and could not, due to an invalid user
or password.  The user should be re-prompted for their username/password
and the function should be called again.

=item WK_ERR_UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR

This status code indicates that a function was called and an error
occurred that can not be recovered from.  If you are in the process of
attempting to log a user in, you have no choice but to display an error
message to the user and not prompt again.

=item WK_ERR_REQUEST_TOKEN_STALE

This status code indicates the user took too long to login, and the the
request token is too old to be used.  The user should be told to retry the
action that caused them to be prompted for authentication.

=item WK_ERR_WEBAUTH_SERVER_ERROR

This status code indicates something happened that most likely indicates
the WebAuth server that made the request is misconfigured and/or
unauthorized to make the request.  It is similar to
WK_ERR_UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR except that the error message to the user
should indicate that the problem is most likely with the server that
redirected them.

=item WK_ERR_LOGIN_FORCED

This status code indicates that a function was called that required a
username and password even if single sign-on credentials were available.
The user should be prompted for their username and password and the
function should be called again with that data.

=item WK_ERR_USER_REJECTED

This status code indicates that the authenticated principal was rejected
by the WebKDC configuration (usually because WebKdcPermittedRealms was set
and the realm of the principal wasn't in that list).

=item WK_ERR_CREDS_EXPIRED

This status code indicates that the principal we attempted to authenticate
to has an expired password.  If possible, the user should be prompted to
change their password and then the operation retried.

=item WK_ERR_MULTIFACTOR_REQUIRED

This status code indicates that authentication was successful but that
authentication with a second factor is also required.  The user should be
prompted for their second factor and then the login reattempted with that
information plus the returned proxy tokens.

=item WK_ERR_MULTIFACTOR_UNAVAILABLE

This status code indicates that the desired site requires multifactor, but
the user does not have multifactor configured or does not have the correct
second factor to authenticate to that site.

=item WK_ERR_LOGIN_REJECT

This status code indicates that this user is not allowed to log on to that
site at this time for security reasons.  This is a transitory error; the
user may be permitted to authenticate later, or from a different location.
This error message is used for rejected logins from particular locations,
logins that appear to be from a compromised account, or accounts that have
been locked out due to too many failed logins.

=item WK_ERR_LOA_UNAVAILABLE

This status code indicates that the site requested a Level of Assurance
for the user's authentication that is higher than this user can provide,
either because of insufficient proof of identity available to the system
or due to an insufficiently strong configured authentication method.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new (STATUS, MESSAGE[, ERROR])

Create a new WebKDC::WebKDCException object.  STATUS is one of the status
constants defined above other than WK_SUCCESS.  MESSAGE is the error
message for the exception.  ERROR, if present, is a protocol error code
that caused the exception.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item status ()

Returns the WebKDC::WebKDCException status code for the exception, which
will be one of the WK_ERR_* codes.

=item message ()

Returns the error message that was passed to the constructor.

=item error_code ()

Returns the WebKDC protocol errorCode (if there was one).

=item verbose_message ()

This method returns a verbose error message, which consists of the status
code, message, and any error code.  The verbose_message method is also
called if the exception is used as a string.
