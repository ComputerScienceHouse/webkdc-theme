TODO file for pending tests

* We currently don't have a clean way to do any tests that rely on cookies.
  CGI.pm doesn't offer the capability to set up a fake cookie like we can
  for parameters.  The long term fix for this will be to abstract out the
  WebLogin code, load more things into the WebLogin object itself (such as
  the cookies), and then only read from that object.  That way we can set
  the object's idea of what the cookies were and test from there.  There
  are many spots in the test files marked with FIXME for where a test
  should be added for after this is done.

* webkdc.t is currently only a stub, not yet complete.  It will require
  a test environment set up on a live WebKDC in order to work, until we
  have a chance to move more of the WebKDC code into a module that Perl
  can access.
