This directory contains additional data files needed to run tests.

In order to run the tests, you will need to grant the test processes
access to modify principals in a test KDC.  This should not be pointed
at a production KDC!  Then, create the following files:

    test.keytab             Keytab for an authorized user
    test.principal          Principal of the authorized user
    test.principal-host     Name of a host principal to test against
    test.principal-webauth  Name of a webauth principal to test against
    test.realm              Kerberos realm
    test.acl                remctld acl file containing the test principal
    test.password           Username and password of a valid test user, with
                            username on first line and password on second
    test.keyring.path       Filename containing path to a server keyring

For test.keyring.path, some tests have us create our own keyring from the
test.keytab, but one set of tests for login requires running on a working
WebKDC server, and uses the system keyring.  If this file contains the
path to the system keyring, use that.  Otherwise, skip the full login
tests.

The keytab and principal will need admin access to the given Kerberos
realm in order to create and change the attributes of a particular
account.

The testing requires Heimdal::Kadm5 and a Heimdal KDC.  Testing against
MIT Kerberos is currently not supported.
