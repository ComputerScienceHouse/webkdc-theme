This directory contains additional data files needed to run tests.

In order to run the tests, you will need to grant the test processes
access to modify principals in a test KDC.  This should not be pointed
at a production KDC!  Then, create the following files:

    test.keytab                 Keytab for an authorized user
    test.principal              Principal of the authorized user
    test.principal-host         Name of a host principal to test against
    test.principal-webauth      Name of a webauth principal to test against
    test.realm                  Kerberos realm
    test.password               Username and password of a valid test user,
                                with username on first line and password on
                                second
    test.keyring.path           File containing path to a server keyring
    test.kadmin-remctl.server   File containing name of a server running the
                                kadmin-remctl package with test.principal
                                allowed to access

For test.keyring.path, some tests have us create our own keyring, but one
set of tests for login requires running on a working WebKDC server, and
uses the system keyring.  If this file contains the path to the system
keyring, use that.  Otherwise, skip the full login tests.
