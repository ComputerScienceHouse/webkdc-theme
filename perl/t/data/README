This directory contains additional data files needed to run tests.

In order to run the tests, you will need to grant the test processes
access to modify principals in a test KDC.  This should not be pointed
at a production KDC!  Then, create the following files:

    test.keytab                 Keytab for an authorized user
    test.principal              Principal of the authorized user
    test.principal-webauth      Name of a webauth principal to test against
    test.realm                  Kerberos realm
    test.password               Username and password of a valid test user,
                                with username on first line and password on
                                second
    test.keyring.path           File containing path to a server keyring
    test.kadmin-remctl.server   File containing name of a server running the
                                kadmin-remctl package that the user running
                                the tests is allowed to access

For test.keyring.path, some tests have us create our own keyring, but one
set of tests for login requires running on a working WebKDC server, and
uses the system keyring.  If this file contains the path to the system
keyring, use that.  Otherwise, skip the full login tests.
