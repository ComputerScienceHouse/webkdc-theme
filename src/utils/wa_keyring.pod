wa_keyring - WebAuth3 keyring manipulation tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<wa_keyring> [-B<-hv>] B<-f> I<file> I<command> [I<arg> ...]

B<wa_keyring> B<-f> I<keyring> add I<valid-after>

B<wa_keyring> B<-f> I<keyring> gc I<oldest-valid-after-to-keep>

B<wa_keyring> B<-f> I<keyring> list

B<wa_keyring> B<-f> I<keyring> remove I<id>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<wa_keyring> is a command line tool to manage WebAuth3 key ring files,
which contain the private AES keys used by mod_webauth and mod_webkdc.  It
supports the following individual commands:

=over 4

=item add I<valid-after>

Adds a new key to the key ring.  I<valid-after> uses the format: 

    nnnn[s|m|h|d|w]

to indicate a time relative to the current time. The units for the time
are specified by appending a single letter.  That letter can be any of s,
m, h, d, or w, which correspond to seconds, minutes, hours, days, and
weeks respectively.

For example: 10d is 10 days from the current time, and -60d is 60 days
before the current time.

=item gc I<oldest-valid-after-to-keep>

Garbage collects (removes) old keys on the key ring.  Any keys with a
I<valid-after> date older then the specified time will be removed from the
key ring.

The format for I<oldest-valid-after-to-keep> is the same as I<valid-after>
from the add command.  Note that this means that times given to the gc
command should generally be negative, to remove keys that have expired in
the past.

=item list

Lists all the keys in the key ring.  By default, a brief listing is
used, but a verbose listing can be requested with the B<-v> option.

The following fields are present in a short listing:

=over 4

=item B<id> 

The index/position of the key in the key ring.

=item B<Created>

The date the key was created.

=item B<Valid after> 

The date at which the key becomes valid (in other words, the point at
which the WebAuth server will start using it to encrypt and decrypt new
data).

=item B<Fingerprint> 

The MD5 digest of the key data.  Used to compare keys in two key rings.

=back 

The following fields are present in the long listing:

=over 4

=item B<Key-Id> 

The index/position of the key in the key ring.

=item B<Created>

The date the key was created.

=item B<Valid-After> 

The date at which the key becomes valid (in other words, the point at
which the WebAuth server will start using it to encrypt and decrypt new
data).

=item B<Key-Type> 

The type of key.  Currently, AES is the only supported key type.

=item B<Key-Size> 

Length in bytes of the key.

=item B<Fingerprint> 

The MD5 digest of the key data. Used to compare keys in two key rings.

=back 

=item remove I<id>

Remove the key with ID I<id> from the key ring.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Add a key to the keyring valid as of the current time:

    wa_keyring -f keyring add 0d

Add a key to the keyring that will be valid three days from now:

    wa_keyring -f keyring add 3d

Remove keys from the key ring that became invalid more than 90 days ago:

    wa_keyring -f keyring gc -90d

Remove the first key in the keyring.

    wa_keyring -f keyring remove 0

Display a verbose listing of all of the keys in the key ring:

    wa_keyring -f keyring -v list

Note that a WebAuth server will normally manage its keyring file by
itself, and B<wa_keyring> is normally only used for debugging purposes.
However, if you are setting up a load-balanced pool of servers that need
to all share the same keys, turn off automatic keyring handling by putting
the line:

    WebAuthKeyringAutoUpdate off

to your Apache configuration, running a script periodically from cron on
one server that does something like:

    wa_keyring -f keyring gc -90d
    wa_keyring -f keyring add 2d

and then copying (in a secure manner!) the new keyring file to all of the
other servers.
