                          WebAuth Change History

WebAuth 3.2.2 (in progress)

 *) Add new WebAuthSSLReturn directive. If an unauth'd user shows up
    via http at a webauth-protected page and gets redirected to weblogin,
    the return URL will be https.

 *) Fixed a bug in libwebauth that prevented wa_keyring from adding keys
    to an empty keyring file.

 *) Add a new mod-config.h for Autoconf results that we want to use in
    module builds, and use this to fix compatibility in mod_webauthldap
    for older versions of the Kerberos libraries and remove code to add
    Autoconf results to the compile command line for mod_webkdc builds.

 *) Fix lots of signed char vs. unsigned char mismatches and warnings by
    changing variable types and adding casts where appropriate.  This
    should significantly reduce the warnings produced when using the Sun
    compiler.

 *) Change C++-style // comments to C commands to make the Sun compiler
    happier.

 *) Improved the wa_keyring POD documentation.

 *) Include the right compiler flags to find the extra Kerberos libraries
    we need when probing for S/Ident, if they're in a non-standard
    location that isn't the same as the S/Ident location.

 *) Fix invalid HTML in the templates for the weblogin script.

 *) Fix some portability issues with non-GNU make.

WebAuth 3.2.1 (2003-09-10)

 *) When AuthType is StanfordAuth, don't default to WebAuthDontCache.
    This appears to break IE 6.0 downloads.

 *) Add WebAuthPostReturnURL directive to allow an app to deal with 
    handling a POST that didn't have authentication.

 *) When operating in legacy mode, only check LDAP for a group if it
    contains a colon.  Otherwise, defer to Apache's normal group handling.

 *) When a call to the LDAP server fails, try binding again and retrying
    the call before actually failing.  The connection may have timed out
    or something else may have temporarily gone wrong.

 *) Improve logging of some LDAP lookup problems.

 *) Make sure the ident_set_authflag call is made after ident_set_authtype
    call.

 *) Corrected handling of successful S/Ident calls returning errors in
    mod_webkdc when debugging is turned off.

 *) Remove some unnecessary debugging code in mod_webkdc.

 *) Fixed an incorrect handling of a string transformation in the attrs
    code, likely only affecting a test failure on Tru64.

 *) Improve the handling of the configure probes to include the right
    prerequisites for Kerberos checks and to probe for libz before cURL.

WebAuth 3.2.0 (2003-08-07)

 *) Added S/Ident support to weblogin and the WebKDC.

 *) Added a preliminary port to Windows.  See windows/BUILD.txt for more
    information.

 *) Fixed bug when handling sub-requests (like in mod_autoindex).  Make
    sure to stash notes in the top-most main request.

 *) Add new WebKDC commands webkdcProxyToken and webkdcProxyTokenInfo.

 *) Add three new functions to libwebauth: webauth_krb5_init_via_cache
    and webauth_krb5_{mk,rd}_req_with_data.

 *) Removed WebAuthProxyHeaders directive.  Added new documentation
    to mod_webauth.xml that recommends people use mod_headers instead.
    See "Using WebAuth with Proxy Servers" in that document.

 *) Modified WebAuthDontCache so it also adds "Pragma: no-cache" and
    "Cache-Control: no-cache" headers in addition to the "Expires" header.

 *) Modified WebAuthDoLogout so when it is enabled so is WebAuthDontCache.

 *) When returning redirects, make sure to set r->header_only so there
    is no extra content generated by Apache.  Also set the same
    Expires, Pragma, and Cache-Control headers that WebAuthDontCache sets.

 *) Increased robustness of the privgroup handling in mod_webauthldap when
    the LDAP query returns multiple entries.  Errors when looking for
    attributes in one entry no longer prevent going on to check for
    attributes in additional entries.

 *) The weblogin test cookie is now a session cookie like the WebAuth
    cookie so that we test what we use and so that it works correctly with
    browsers that disable non-session cookies.

 *) Build portability fix for Tru64 and other platforms whose sed cannot
    handle multiline patterns.

 *) Removed extra logging from mod_webauth/webkdc.c, and moved other
    extraneous logging so its only logged at a level of APLOG_DEBUG when
    WebAuthDebug is turned on.

 *) Added package-webauth and package-webkdc targets for maintainers to
    generate WebAuth module packages.

 *) DESTDIR support fixed for WebKDC installations.

 *) Tweaks to the WebKDC templates and images.

WebAuth 3.1.2 (2003-05-29)

 *) mod_webauthldap: Added mutexes around the entire ldap operation to 
    avoid GSSAPI thread safety issues.  All server_rec structures are now 
    initialized, correctly supporting multiple virtual host 
    configurations.  Refactored ldap binds for better failback support,
    fixing a double free memory error.  Additional memory cleanup for 
    krb5 TGT operations. Fixed memory leak related to unbind after 
    connection expiry, via ignoring SIGPIPE.

 *) mod_webauth: Correctly construct the return url for reverse proxies 
    (explicitly compare r->proxyreq to PROXYREQ_PROXY instead of testing 
    for != PROXYREQ_NONE, which also matched PROXYREQ_REVERSE.

 *) mod_webauth: Don't try to attr decode a zero length service token 
    cache file.  Log a warning and return NULL like there was no file.

 *) Update configure.ac to check for netinet/in.h for windows build.

 *) Modify wa_keyring to not use getopt (not available on windows),
    and change strftime format from %T to %H:%M:%S (%T also not available
    on windows strftime).

 *) Fix a bug in libwebauth/krb5.c where we would try to call
    krb5_free_context on a NULL context.

 *) Expanded the libgcc linking hack to apply to all of the module builds
    rather than just the cURL link flags, since it showed up on Solaris 7
    affecting mod_webauthldap as well.  This fix is specific to Solaris.

 *) Ported the test suite driver to AIX 4.3 and tweaked the OpenLDAP
    library probe to handle operating systems without shared library
    dependencies.

 *) Fixed the installation rule for the test suite to properly honor
    DESTDIR.

 *) Cleaned up the sample configuration files somewhat and made them more
    consistent with each other.

WebAuth 3.1.1 (2003-05-08)

 *) Fixed HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT in src/webkdc/logout.fcgi script by
    changing the path to relative instead of absolute.

WebAuth 3.1.0 (2003-05-01)

 *) Add WebAuthSSLRedirect and WebAuthSSLRedirectPort directives to
    enable redirecting of users from http to https when accessing
    a WebAuth-protected resource.

 *) Add WebAuthWebKdcSSLCertCheck directive to enable/disable checking
    of the WebKDC SSL certificate. Defaults to "on" and should only
    be turned off for debugging/testing purposes.

 *) Added mod_webauthldap for LDAP directory information lookups via
    Kerberos v5 GSS-API binds.

 *) Add new WebAuthDontCache directive which sets r->no_cache. Defaults
    to 0 (allow documents to be cached).

 *) Allow these directives to present in .htaccess files (they were
    previously only allowed in <Directory>/<Location> directives):

    WebAuthExtraRedirect
    WebAuthReturnURL
    WebAuthLoginCanceledURL
    WebAuthVarPrefix

 *) Add more backward compatibility support for WebAuth 2.5 by allowing
    the following directives to appear in .htaccess files:

    StanfordAuthConfirmMsg  -> ignored

    StanfordAuthDoConfirm   -> warns to error_log if set to on

    StanfordAuthDontCache   -> maps to WebAuthDontCache. If AuthType
                               is set to StanfordAuth, defaults to 1.

    StanfordAuthForceReload -> maps to WebAuthExtraRedirect

    StanfordAuthLife        -> maps to WebAuthAppTokenLifetime and enables
                               WebAuthForceLogin

    StanfordAuthReturnURL   -> maps to WebAuthReturnURL

    StanfordAuthGroups      -> unsupported, if specified access is denied
   
 *) Have the WebKDC re-read the token ACL file if its mtime changes.

 *) Added WebAuthAuthType directive to help people transistion to
    mod_webauth.  This directive allows you to specify an additional
    AuthType name that will be treated the same as WebAuth.  If
    this directive is set to StanfordAuth, it will also set two
    extra environment variables: SU_AUTH_USER and SU_AUTH_AGE.

 *) Cleanup environment variable setting. Set environment variables
    (r->subprocess_env) in check_user_id hook instead of waiting
    until fixups hook to make them more accessible to other hooks/modules.

 *) When scrubbing tokens from r->args and r->parsed_uri.query, look
    for "?WEBAUTHR=" first then "WEBAUTHR=", since if there were no
    query args, the tokens could get parsed as query args. This
    caused tokens to show up as query args when we changed from
    ";WEBAUTHR=" to "?WEBAUTHR=".

 *) If we are proxying a request, strip out all webauth_* cookies and
    and webauth tokens from Referer header.  Also, if we are proxying
    or the URI passed to the server in the HTTP request has a scheme,
    use it as the return URL instead of constructing one relative to the
    server.

 *) Modify WebAuthKeytab and WebKdcKeytab directives so 
    you can optionally specify which principal to use with
    the specified keytab, instead of using the first principal found.
    This required modifying webauth_krb5_* APIs.
 
 *) Implement WebAuthProxyHeaders directive.  See WebAuth module
    documentation for more information.

 *) Clean up header includes in tests and wa_keyring.

 *) mod_{webauth,webkdc}.h - "module" declaration should be extern.

 *) Remove the service token cache in mod_webauth on restarts.

 *) Restructured the mod_webauth code to define a pluggable credential
    interface, isolating all credential-related functions so that new
    credential types can easily be supported.

 *) Added --with-apxs configure option to set the path to apxs
    independently from the path to the Apache installation.

WebAuth 3.0.0 (2003-02-18)

 *) Initial public release.
