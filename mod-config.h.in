/* mod-config.h.in -- Stripped config.h.in for use with Apache modules.
   $Id$

   We can't include the regular config.h into Apache modules because many
   of the symbols defined by Autoconf conflict with symbols that are also
   defined by the APR headers.  This is a hand-maintained template that
   contains a small subset of what config.h defines, just those symbols
   that we want to use in the module code. */

/* Define to 1 to include S/Ident support. */
