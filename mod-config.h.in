/* mod-config.h.in -- Stripped config.h.in for use with Apache modules.

   We can't include the regular config.h into Apache modules because many
   of the symbols defined by Autoconf conflict with symbols that are also
   defined by the APR headers.  This is a hand-maintained template that
   contains a small subset of what config.h defines, just those symbols
   that we want to use in the module code. */
