# Now limit our memory to 3.5MB and then try the large ones again, all of

#
# The exact memory limits used here are essentially black magic.  They need to
# be large enough to allow the program to be loaded and do small allocations,
# but not so large that we can't reasonably expect to allocate that much
# memory normally.  3.5MB seems to work reasonably well on both Solaris and
# Linux.
#
# We assume that there are enough miscellaneous allocations that an allocation
# exactly as large as the limit will always fail.
