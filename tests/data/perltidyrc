# Default options for perltidy for proper Perl code reformatting.

-l=79           # usually use 78, but don't want 79-long lines reformatted
-pt=2           # don't add extra whitespace around parentheses
-sbt=2          # ...or square brackets
-sfs            # no space before semicolon in for (not that I use this form)
