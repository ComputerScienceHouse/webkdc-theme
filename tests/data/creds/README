This directory contains encoded Kerberos credentials created with various
versions of WebAuth to test stability of credential decoding.  The script
tests/data/make-krb5-cred shows how to generate an encoded Kerberos
credential from a ticket cache.

These files are used primarily by tests/lib/krb5-cred-t.c.  If any of them
are regenerated, that test suite will have to be changed to check for the
updated values.

The key properties of these credentials are as follows:
