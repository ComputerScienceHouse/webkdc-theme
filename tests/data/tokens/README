The tokens in this directory are generated by tests/data/make-tokens using
the configuration file tests/data/tokens.conf.  Some of the tokens were
generated by older versions of WebAuth and use a different order for the
attributes.  In general, it's best not to recreate them, since the spread
of different versions tests backward-compatibility decoding tokens created
by earlier encoding algorithms.

All of the tokens are encrypted in the key in tests/data/keyring.

These tokens are primarily used by tests/lib/token-decode-t.c and
tests/lib/token-crypto-t.c in the main test suite and by
perl/t/token-decode.t in the Perl module test suite.
