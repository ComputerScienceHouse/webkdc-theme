This directory contains data used by WebAuth's test suite.  To enable
tests for the WebAuth Kerberos functionality, create a Kerberos keytab and
put it in this directory as test.keytab.  Then, create a file named
test.principal and in it put the principal name corresponding to the key
in the keytab on a single line ending with a newline.  Finally, create a
file named test.password that contains two lines.  The first line should
be a test principal and the second line should be the password for that
principal.  The newline is not taken to be part of the password.

The presence of these two files will enable the Kerberos tests.
