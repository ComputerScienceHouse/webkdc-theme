This directory contains configuration required to run the complete WebAuth
test suite.  If there is no configuration in this directory, some of the
tests will be skipped.  To enable the full test suite, create the
following files:

keytab

    A valid Kerberos keytab for a principal, preferrably in your local
    realm.  This will be used to test network interactions that require
    Kerberos authentication.

password

    This file should contain two lines.  The first line is the
    fully-qualified principal (including the realm) of a Kerberos
    principal to use for testing authentication.  The second line is the
    password for that principal.  The realm of the principal must be
    configured in your system krb5.conf file or in DNS configuration
    picked up by your Kerberos libraries, including the kpasswd server,
    and must be in the same realm as the keytab above or have valid
    cross-realm trust to it.
