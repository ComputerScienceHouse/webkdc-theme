/*
 * Utility functions for tests that use subprocesses.
 *
 * Provides utility functions for subprocess manipulation.  Specifically,
 * provides a function, run_setup, which runs a command and bails if it fails,
 * using its error message as the bail output, and is_function_output, which
 * runs a function in a subprocess and checks its output and exit status
 * against expected values.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
