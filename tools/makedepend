# makedepend -- Generate dependencies for makefiles.
#
# This shell script automates the process of updating the dependencies in
# Makefile.in.  It uses gcc -MM to do this, since only the maintainers should
# normally have to do this and using a compiler to parse include directives is
# more reliable than more ad hoc methods.  It takes compiler flags as its
# first argument and then a list of all source files to process.
#
# The Makefile is updated in place, and everything after "DO NOT DELETE THIS
# LINE" is removed and replaced by the dependencies.
