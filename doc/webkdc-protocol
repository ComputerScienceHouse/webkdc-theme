Overview 

	This document discusses the protocol used by the webkdc 
link of the Stanford webauthv3 authentication system. The purpose
of this part of the webauthv3 system is to obtain long lived
user credentials that can be used by the rest of the system 
to obtain short term credentials for a specific service. 

	The protocol consists of an exchange of xml formatted 
messages over a secure tcp based connection. The format of the xml
messages is independent of the underlying transport. The transport
should only provide data-integrity and privacy. The xml messages
must contain all the needed authentication data. 

	A protocol interaction consists of a single xml message
from the client and a single xml message response from the server.
It should be possible for multiple messages to be processed over
a single underlying transport connection. 

	The message formats will be defined using the W3C Xschema
definition language, but the exact methods of parsing of the xml 
is left to the implementation.

	Type 1 Username/Password
