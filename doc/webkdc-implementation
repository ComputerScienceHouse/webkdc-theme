Overview:

	This document discusses some of the issues in implementing
the webkdc part of the Stanford Webauth V3 authentication system. 
The purpose of this part of the webauthv3 system is to obtain long lived
user credentials that can be used by the rest of the system 
to obtain short term credentials for a specific service. The protocol
is discussed in webkdc-protocol. 


Requirements:

	The basic requirement is to support the protocol, but
there are some additional usage requirements. 

	There needs to be more than one webKDC machine for 
load balancing and reliability requirements. 

	The credentials issued by any one of the webKDCs must
be useable at any other webKDCs. 

	The rough estimate of maximum load on the whole system
is 5 requests/sec. 

	The webKDC needs to be able to make authority decisions
on what tickets to provide based on the following criteria:

	1. Type of authentication (username/passwd vs tgt)

	2. User principal ( optional in first release )

	3. Requesting server

	4. Service principal requested. 

	The underlying connection protocol (i.e. ssl ) must provide
date security and integrity, but does not need to provide authentication.

	A very strong form of encryption is needed for encrypting/decrypting
the ticket granting tickets. 

	The encryption keys used for encrypting/decrypting the tgt's
must be changed on a regular basis.
