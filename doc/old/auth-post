The data posted by webloginplus.stanford.edu back to the webauth server
consists of the following fields.  In the following description, the
"referral" is the data contained in the GET request with which the user
was originally sent to the weblogin server.

    version             The version number of the auth POST protocol.
    auth-type           Type of authenticator.
    auth-data           Authenticator for that service (from the WebKDC).
    server-identity     Server identity as specified in the referral.
    return-url          Return URL as specified in the referral.

It may contain the following field if it was present in the referral from
the webauth server.

    session-id          Session ID as specified in the referral.

If the referral requested proxy authentication (with the px field), one or
both of the following fields may also be present:

    k4tgt               Encrypted Kerberos v4 TGT cookie.
    k5tgt               Encrypted Kerberos v5 TGT cookie.

The contents of these fields are already suitable for being placed in a
cookie returned to the user's browser; the webauth server doesn't need to
do any parsing of them whatsoever.
