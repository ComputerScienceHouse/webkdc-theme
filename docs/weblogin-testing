Manual login (username/password):
* Test login
* Test incorrect password
* Test page validation (no username, no password) fails correctly

Remuser:
* Test auto-login with SPNEGO setup

Complete SPNEGO login:
Not yet doing -- requires rewriting settings.fcgi in stanford-weblogin.

* Test gets warning
* Test page opens in new tab or window
* After that, flows into same logic as testing with expired password

* Test change password
* Test too-short new password fails correctly
* Test password reuse fails correctly
* Test page validation (no password, no new password, new passwords not
  matching) fails correctly

Direct password change:
* Test change password
* Test incorrect current password fails correctly
* Test too-short new password fails correctly
* Test password reuse fails correctly
* Test page validation (no username, no password, no new password, new
  passwords not matching) fails correctly
