                Stanford WebAuth Installation Instructions

OVERVIEW

    This document describes installation of WebAuth for web server
    administrators at Stanford University, including Stanford-specific
    configuration and setup details.  For general installation
    instructions, see the INSTALL file at the root of the WebAuth
    distribution.

    If you have trouble with these instructions, please file a HelpSU
    ticket giving your system name, the operating system it's running, how
    far you got in these instructions, and exactly what is failing
    (including error messages and similar information).

COMPILING, TESTING, and INSTALLATION

    Where possible, you should use pre-built WebAuth packages rather than
    building WebAuth yourself.  The pre-built packages are built with
    known options and tested for compatibility and functionality with the
    operating system platforms on which they're built.  They also mean
    less installation effort.

    For Debian or Ubuntu users, install the libapache2-webauth package.
    This package is included in the base releases of both Debian and
    Ubuntu.  Newer versions for Debian may also be available from the
    backports.debian.org repository; see:

        <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/>

    for information on how to install packages from backports.debian.org.

    For Red Hat Enterprise users, WebAuth packages are available from our
    local yum repository.  See:

        <http://www.stanford.edu/services/linux/up2date-yum-repos.html>

    for information on how to configure your system to install packages
    from Stanford's local repository.  You can also simply download and
    install the RPMs from the WebAuth distribution page at:

        <http://webauth.stanford.edu/download.html>

    but it's better to use the yum repository if possible since then you
    can easily install newer versions as they're released.  The package
    name for Red Hat systems is just webauth.

    For Fedora users and other Red Hat users who cannot use the RHEL
    packages unmodified, the best approach is probably to start from the
    source packages available on the WebAuth distribution page and rebuild
    them for your local system.

    On other platforms, you will need to build and install WebAuth
    yourself.  Follow the general installation instructions up through the
    INSTALLATION section, and then return to this document.

CONFIGURATION

  Apache Directives

    On Debian or Ubuntu, create /etc/apache2/conf.d/stanford-webauth with
    the following contents:

        WebAuthLoginURL https://weblogin.stanford.edu/login/
        WebAuthWebKdcURL https://weblogin.stanford.edu/webkdc-service/
        WebAuthWebKdcPrincipal service/webkdc@stanford.edu

    and then run a2enmod webauth.  Depending on the Apache version, you
    may also need to run a2enmod authz_user.  That's all the custom Apache
    configuration you should need on those platforms.

    On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 (or equivalent) systems, create the
    file /etc/httpd/conf.d/stanford-webauth.conf with the same contents as
    given above.

    For other systems, such as systems where one has built Apache and
    WebAuth by hand, copy conf/stanford-webauth.conf from the WebAuth
    source tree into your Apache 2.x conf directory and then add the line:

        Include conf/stanford-webauth.conf

    in the Apache httpd.conf file.  This file assumes that the WebAuth
    module is installed in /usr/local/libexec/apache2/modules.  You will
    need to change the LoadModule line in that file if it's installed in
    some other path.  You will also need to ensure that the directory
    conf/webauth under your Apache root directory exists and is writable
    by the running web server.  That directory should be writable by the
    user and group specified in the User and Group directives in your
    httpd.conf.  This is taken care of for you on Debian, Ubutu, and Red
    Hat.

  Keytab

    To use the Stanford WebAuth service, you will need to create a keytab
    for the principal webauth/<system> where <system> is the
    fully-qualified hostname of the host.  You do this using the wallet
    program.

    First, install the wallet client on your system.  Instructions for how
    to do this are at:

        <http://itservices.stanford.edu/service/kerberos/wallet>

    Next, ensure that you are listed in NetDB as the administrator, user,
    or admin team member for the system on which you're installing
    WebAuth.  Permissions to download keytabs for systems is controlled by
    the NetDB data for that system.  (If you are installing WebAuth on a
    system that's not registered in NetDB, such as an external system used
    for Stanford purposes, but still want to use the Stanford WebAuth
    service, file a HelpSU ticket with the name of the system so that a
    wallet entry can be custom-created for it.)

    Determine the path into which the keytab should be installed on your
    system.  If you are using the Debian, Ubuntu, or Red Hat packages,
    this path should be /etc/webauth/keytab.  If you are using your own
    build of WebAuth, it should be conf/webauth/keytab under your Apache
    root.  The location is controlled by the WebAuthKeytab directive in
    the Apache configuration.

    Finally, create the keytab with wallet:

        wallet -f <path> get keytab webauth/<system>

    where <path> is the path as determined above and <system> is the
    fully-qualified name of the system.

    After installing the keytab, make sure it is readable by the user and
    group that the web server runs as.  Usually this can be done with:

        chmod 640 <path>
        chgrp apache <path>

    or whatever group is specified in the Group directive of your Apache
    configuration.

  SSL Certificate

    An SSL certificate is required to use WebAuth.  Stanford users who
    need an SSL certificate for university applications can obtain one
    from the university's SSL certificate vendor.  For more information,
    see:

        <http://www.stanford.edu/services/ssl/>

    A PTA is required and will be charged the cost of the certificate that
    the certificate vendor charges Stanford.

    If you do not want to purchase an SSL certificate through this service
    or are not eligible, see the SSL Certificate section in the regular
    installation instructions for details on how to create a self-signed
    certificate.  Or, of course, you can purchase your own certificate
    separately or use an organization like cacert.org.

    If you are using the Debian or Ubuntu Apache packages, you will need
    to explicitly enable the SSL Apache module with a2enmod ssl.  You will
    then also need to configure the location of your SSL certificate and
    key file.  For Debian and Ubuntu, the best location for the
    certificate is /etc/ssl/certs, and for the key is /etc/ssl/private.
    Example configuration:

        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/<hostname>.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/<hostname>.key
        SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!ADH:!SSLv2:@STRENGTH
        SSLProtocol all -SSLv2

    The last two configuration lines disable weak SSL ciphers.  You can
    use similar configuration directives for other operating systems, but
    may need to change SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile.

    See /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz for more
    information about configuring SSL on Debian and Ubuntu systems,
    including how to generate and use self-signed certificates.

    If your certificate came with intermediate CA certificates, you may
    need to save them on your system (/etc/ssl/certs is recommended for
    Debian and Ubuntu systems) and configure that file in Apache as well
    with:

        SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/<chain-name>.crt

    replacing <chain-name> with something documenting the intermediate CA
    certificate chain stored in that file.

  LDAP Configuration

    If you want to do more than determine the user's identity, such as use
    privgroups (workgroups) to control access to resources or obtain
    additional information about authenticated users such as their full
    name and e-mail address, you will need permissions to query the
    Stanford LDAP servers and additional configuration to enable the
    mod_webauthldap module.

    First, any access to the LDAP servers (at least for purposes relevant
    to WebAuth) requires university approval.  There are, at present, no
    exceptions.  For this approval process, which requires requesting
    access from each university data owner, see:

        <http://www.stanford.edu/services/directory/access/>

    and follow the sidebar links.  To use workgroups to control access,
    you generally want the set of permissions called WebAuth General.  The
    principal for which you should request access is the webauth principal
    for your system that you created above in the Keytab instructions.

    Once you've been granted access, configure mod_webauthldap.  For
    Debian and Ubuntu systems, add:

        WebAuthLdapHost ldap.stanford.edu
        WebAuthLdapBase cn=people,dc=stanford,dc=edu
        WebAuthLdapAuthorizationAttribute suPrivilegeGroup

    to /etc/apache2/conf.d/stanford-webauth and run a2enmod webauthldap.
    For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 (or equivalent) systems, add those
    same lines to /etc/httpd/conf.d/stanford-webauth.conf.

    For other systems, such as systems where one has built Apache and
    WebAuth by hand, copy conf/stanford-ldap.conf from the WebAuth
    source tree into your Apache 2.x conf directory and then add the line:

        Include conf/stanford-ldap.conf

    in the Apache httpd.conf file.  This file assumes that the WebAuth
    module is installed in /usr/local/libexec/apache2/modules.  You will
    need to change the LoadModule line in that file if it's installed in
    some other path.  If you have moved the path to the keytab, you will
    need to also change the WebAuthLdapKeytab directive in this file.

TESTING

    For testing instructions, see the sections Basic Testing and RUNNING
    THE TEST SUITE in the standard install instructions.
