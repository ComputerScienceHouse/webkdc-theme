                       User-Visible WebAuth Changes

WebAuth 3.1.0 (in progress)

 *) have the WebKDC re-read the token ACL file if its mtime changes

 *) Added WebAuthAuthType directive to help people transistion to
    mod_webauth. This directive allows you to specify an additional
    AuthType name that will be treated the same as WebAuth. If
    this directive is set to StanfordAuth, it will also set two
    extra environment variables: SU_AUTH_USER and SU_AUTH_AGE.

 *) when scrubbing tokens from r->args and r->parsed_uri.query, look
    for "?WEBAUTHR=" first then "WEBAUTHR=", since if there were no
    query args, the tokens could get parsed as query args. This
    caused tokens to show up as query args when we changed from ";WEBAUTHR="
    to "?WEBAUTHR=".

 *) Modify WebAuthKeytab and WebKdcKeytab directives so 
    you can optionally specify which principal to use with
    the specified keytab, instead of using the first principal found.

 *) Added WebAuthProxyHeaders directive to pass WebAuth information to
    a proxied server. See the WebAuth module documentation for more
    information.

 *) Remove the service token cache on restarts

WebAuth 3.0.0 (2003-02-18)

 *) Initial public release of WebAuth v3.  This is a complete rewrite of
    the WebAuth system, sharing no common code with the previous release.
    It is now based on Apache 2.0, Kerberos v5, and a new infrastructure
    for managing authentication tokens.

 *) This is the initial release with basic authentication support and Perl
    bindings only.
