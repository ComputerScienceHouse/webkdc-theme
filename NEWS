                       User-Visible WebAuth Changes

WebAuth 3.1.0 (in progress)

 *) Added mod_webauthldap for LDAP directory information lookups via
    Kerberos v5 GSS-API binds.

 *) Added WebAuthAuthType directive to help people transistion to
    mod_webauth.  This directive allows you to specify an additional
    AuthType name that will be treated the same as WebAuth.  If
    this directive is set to StanfordAuth, it will also set two
    extra environment variables: SU_AUTH_USER and SU_AUTH_AGE.

 *) Add more backward compatibility support for WebAuth 2.5 by allowing
    the following directives to appear in .htaccess files:

    StanfordAuthConfirmMsg  -> ignored

    StanfordAuthDoConfirm   -> warns to error_log if set to on

    StanfordAuthDontCache   -> maps to WebAuthDontCache. If AuthType
                               is set to StanfordAuth, defaults to 1.

    StanfordAuthForceReload -> maps to WebAuthExtraRedirect

    StanfordAuthLife        -> maps to WebAuthAppTokenLifetime and enables
                               WebAuthForceLogin

    StanfordAuthReturnURL   -> maps to WebAuthReturnURL

    StanfordAuthGroups      -> unsupported, if specified access is denied

 *) Allow these directives to present in .htaccess files (they were
    previously only allowed in <Directory>/<Location> directives):
  
    WebAuthExtraRedirect
    WebAuthReturnURL
    WebAuthLoginCanceledURL
    WebAuthVarPrefix

 *) Added WebAuthProxyHeaders directive to pass WebAuth information to
    a proxied server.  See the WebAuth module documentation for more
    information.

 *) Add WebAuthWebKdcSSLCertCheck directive to enable/disable checking
    of the WebKDC SSL certificate. Defaults to "on" and should only
    be turned off for debugging/testing purposes.

 *) Add new WebAuthDontCache directive which sets r->no_cache. Defaults
    to 0 (allow documents to be cached).

 *) Modify WebAuthKeytab and WebKdcKeytab directives so you can
    optionally specify which principal to use with the specified keytab,
    instead of using the first principal found.

 *) Remove the service token cache on restarts

 *) Have the WebKDC re-read the token ACL file if its mtime changes.

 *) Added --with-apxs configure option to set the path to apxs
    independently from the path to the Apache installation.

 *) When scrubbing tokens from r->args and r->parsed_uri.query, look
    for "?WEBAUTHR=" first then "WEBAUTHR=", since if there were no
    query args, the tokens could get parsed as query args.  This
    caused tokens to show up as query args when we changed from
    ";WEBAUTHR=" to "?WEBAUTHR=".

WebAuth 3.0.0 (2003-02-18)

 *) Initial public release of WebAuth v3.  This is a complete rewrite of
    the WebAuth system, sharing no common code with the previous release.
    It is now based on Apache 2.0, Kerberos v5, and a new infrastructure
    for managing authentication tokens.

 *) This is the initial release with basic authentication support and Perl
    bindings only.
