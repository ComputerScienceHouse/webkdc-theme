WebAuth 3.0.0 (2003-02-18)

    Initial public release of WebAuth v3.  This is a complete rewrite of
    the WebAuth system, sharing no common code with the previous release.
    It is now based on Apache 2.0, Kerberos v5, and a new infrastructure
    for managing authentication tokens.

    This is the initial release with basic authentication support and Perl
    bindings only.
