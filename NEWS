                       User-Visible WebAuth Changes

WebAuth 3.2.0 (in progress)

 *) Removed WebAuthProxyHeaders directive. Added new documentation
    to mod_webauth.xml that recommends people use mod_headers instead.
    See "Using WebAuth with Proxy Servers" in that document.

 *) Modified WebAuthDontCache so it also adds "Pragma: no-cache" and
    "Cache-Control: no-cache" headers in addition to the "Expires" header.

 *) Modified WebAuthDoLogout so when it is enabled so is WebAuthDontCache 

 *) When returning redirects, make sure to set r->header_only so there
    is no extra content generated by Apache. Also set the same
    Expires, Pragma, and Cache-Control headers that WebAuthDontCache sets.

 *) removed extra logging from mod_webauth/webkdc.c, and moved
    other extraneous logging so its only logged at a level of
    APLOG_DEBUG when WebAuthDebug is turned on.

WebAuth 3.1.2 (2003-05-29)

 *) mod_webauthldap has several bugfixes, supports multiple virtualhosts,
    and has better memory utilization and thread safety improvements.

 *) Correctly construct the return URL for reverse proxies.

 *) Ported to Solaris 7 with gcc 2.95.  Basic WebAuth (but not LDAP)
    ported to AIX 4.3.

WebAuth 3.1.1 (2003-05-08)

 *) Fixed HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT in src/webkdc/logout.fcgi script by
    changing the path to relative instead of absolute.

WebAuth 3.1.0 (2003-05-01)

 *) Added a new Apache module, mod_webauthldap, for LDAP directory
    information lookups via Kerberos v5 GSS-API binds.  This module
    provides the same directory lookup capability as older versions of
    WebAuth, but does so against OpenLDAP servers, via Kerberos v5
    authentication, and with considerably more flexible support for what
    attributes to query. See the mod_webauthldap manual for more details.

 *) Added WebAuthSSLRedirect and WebAuthSSLRedirectPort directives so
    that users can be redirected from http to https when accessing
    a WebAuth-protected resource.

 *) Added a WebAuthAuthType directive to help people transition to
    mod_webauth from older versions.  This directive allows you to specify
    an additional AuthType name that will be treated the same as WebAuth.
    If this directive is set to StanfordAuth, it will also set two extra
    environment variables: SU_AUTH_USER and SU_AUTH_AGE (these were set
    by WebAuth 2.5).

 *) Added more backward compatibility support for WebAuth 2.5 by allowing
    the following directives to appear in .htaccess files:

    StanfordAuthConfirmMsg  -> ignored

    StanfordAuthDoConfirm   -> warns to error_log if set to on

    StanfordAuthDontCache   -> maps to WebAuthDontCache. If AuthType
                               is set to StanfordAuth, defaults to 1.

    StanfordAuthForceReload -> maps to WebAuthExtraRedirect

    StanfordAuthLife        -> maps to WebAuthAppTokenLifetime and enables
                               WebAuthForceLogin

    StanfordAuthReturnURL   -> maps to WebAuthReturnURL

    StanfordAuthGroups      -> unsupported, if specified access is denied

 *) Allowed these directives to be present in .htaccess files (they were
    previously only allowed in <Directory>/<Location> directives):

        WebAuthExtraRedirect
        WebAuthReturnURL
        WebAuthLoginCanceledURL
        WebAuthVarPrefix

    This is in partial support of backward compatibility.

 *) Added WebAuthProxyHeaders directive to pass WebAuth information to
    a proxied server.  See the WebAuth module documentation for more
    information.

 *) Added WebAuthWebKdcSSLCertCheck directive to enable/disable checking
    of the WebKDC SSL certificate.  Defaults to "on" and should only
    be turned off for debugging/testing purposes.

 *) Added new WebAuthDontCache directive, which signals a browser not to
    cache those web pages.  Defaults to 0 (allow documents to be cached).

 *) Modified WebAuthKeytab and WebKdcKeytab directives so you can
    optionally specify which principal to use with the specified keytab,
    instead of using the first principal found.  This is useful if the
    keytab contains multiple keys.

 *) Removed the service token cache on restarts, so that a restart will
    clear up any inconsistencies between the server and the WebKDC.

 *) Have the WebKDC re-read the token ACL file if its mtime changes.

 *) Added --with-apxs configure option to set the path to apxs
    independently from the path to the Apache installation.  This was
    needed in order to easily build WebAuth on Linux distributions that
    install Apache following the Linux Filesystem Standard.

 *) Bug fixed in scrubbing WebAuth tokens from the URL.

WebAuth 3.0.0 (2003-02-18)

 *) Initial public release of WebAuth v3.  This is a complete rewrite of
    the WebAuth system, sharing no common code with the previous release.
    It is now based on Apache 2.0, Kerberos v5, and a new infrastructure
    for managing authentication tokens.

 *) This is the initial release with basic authentication support and Perl
    bindings only.
