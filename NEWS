                       User-Visible WebAuth Changes

WebAuth 3.7.0 (unreleased)

    The WebAuthLdapAuthRule directive in mod_webauthldap has been fixed to
    do something closer to its documentation.  Previously, it was
    documented as containing "group <privgroup>" if the user was
    authorized by a privgroup directive, but actually contained only the
    privgroup.  Now, it contains "privgroup <privgroup>" if the user was
    authorized by a privgroup directive.  Patch from Ian Ward Comfort.

    mod_webauthldap supports a new WebAuthLdapPrivgroup directive that
    names a list of privgroups against which the authenticated user's
    membership should be checked.  All privgroups listed of which the user
    is a member will be put into the WEBAUTH_LDAPPRIVGROUP environment
    variable.  Patch from Ian Ward Comfort.

    The WebAuthLdapAttribute directive can now take multiple attributes on
    the same line.  Patch from Ian Ward Comfort.

    WebLogin now includes a password change script and associated template
    to allow users to change their Kerberos password.

    WebLogin now supports password expiration.  If the account password is
    expired when a user authenticates with a password at the WebLogin
    login screen, they are redirected to the password change screen,
    forced to change their password, and then reauthenticated with their
    new password so that they can continue as normal with their
    authentication.

    WebLogin can be optionally configured to warn users, via the
    confirmation screen, if their password is about to expire.  Currently,
    this warning requires remctl, configuration of a Kerberos ticket
    cache, and the kadmin-remctl backend running somewhere for that
    Kerberos realm.

    The WebAuth Apache modules are no longer built with apxs, which allows
    a cleaner build and installation process.  However, this means that
    the modules are now installed in <libexecdir>/apache2/modules by
    default, where <libexecdir> is specified via the --libexecdir flag to
    configure and defaults to /usr/local/libexec.

    The --with-apache option has been dropped.  Use --with-apxs to specify
    the full path to apxs if it's not in your PATH.

    The --enable-mod_webkdc flag is now --enable-webkdc, since it also
    controls installation of the WebLogin scripts and templates.

    The --enable-debug flag has been dropped.  Set CFLAGS on the configure
    command line if you want to override the default compiler flags.

    Catch SIGTERM in the login.fcgi script and only exit once processing
    of the current request has completed.  mod_fastcgi restarts FastCGI
    scripts periodically by killing the old one with SIGTERM, which
    previously could result in internal server errors handed back to the
    client if the script was killed in the middle of processing a request.

    Correctly encode RT and ST tokens in the URL when redirecting to an
    alternate URL to attempt REMOTE_USER authentication in WebLogin.
    Patch from Ian Ward Comfort.

    The majority of the WebLogin scripts have been moved into a new
    WebLogin Perl module, which should make it somewhat easier to further
    customize the WebLogin interface if desired.

    The timestamps output by wa_keyring list now contain dates in the ISO
    format YYYY-MM-DD instead of the US-centric and ambiguous MM/DD/YYYY.

    Removed the webauth_krb5_service_principal function from libwebauth
    and from the WebAuth Perl module.  This function's API was
    fundamentally flawed since it did not handle realms, and it was not
    used anywhere in the WebAuth code.

    Change the libwebauth API to use size_t and other data types more
    correctly instead of always using int.  This will require updates in
    all calling applications.

    wa_keyring calls the OpenSSL MD5 functions directly, so explicitly
    link it with libcrypto.  Fixes build failures with gold.

    Avoid importing isa from UNIVERSAL in the WebAuth Perl modules.  This
    is deprecated in Perl 5.12 and later.

    Mention setting $KEYRING_PATH in docs/install-spnego and expand the
    documentation in docs/weblogin-config.

    Changed terminology in the WebAuth protocol specification to refer to
    a KRB_AP_REQ rather than the results of krb5_mk_req.  The latter is a
    call specific to a particular API, whereas the former is the term used
    in the Kerberos protocol documentation.  Thanks, Liam Atkinson.

    The Autoconf probe for the cURL libraries now uses curl-config if
    available.  The path to curl-config can be overridden by setting the
    CURL_CONFIG variable on the configure command line or in the
    environment.

    Update to rra-c-util 2.4:

    * Use rra-c-util portability layer for libwebauth and wa_keyring.
    * Use rra-c-util utility library for wa_keyring.
    * Use --with-krb5 instead of --with-kerberos for Kerberos path.
    * Add --with-krb5-lib and --with-krb5-include configure flags.
    * Much better handling of Kerberos library detection.
    * Use Kerberos portability code from rra-c-util.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.3:

    * Support running a single test with tests/runtests -o.
    * Better reporting of fatal errors in the test suite.
    * Rewrite of all test cases to use the new TAP library support.
    * Summarize results at the end of test execution.

WebAuth 3.6.2 (2009-09-10)

    SECURITY: When generating the redirect to test for cookie support if
    the test cookie is not already set, be sure not to include the
    username and password query fields in the redirect URL.  Otherwise,
    the user's password could be logged in the Apache logs and possibly be
    included in referrer information sent by the browser.

    SECURITY: Reject username/password logins via methods other than POST,
    since continuing risks exposing the password in the browser history
    and via referrer information.

    If the user submits the login form via POST without including the test
    cookie, assume that the browser supports cookies and proceed.  We
    won't present the initial login form without seeing the test cookie,
    so something strange is happening.  Continuing and assuming everything
    will work seems to be the best approach.

    Add tools/weblogin-passcheck to examine Apache logs looking for users
    who were affected by the above security vulnerabilities.  This script
    is not installed by default but is provided in the distribution for
    WebLogin administrators to use to determine the scope of this problem.
    For documentation, run tools/weblogin-passcheck -h.

WebAuth 3.6.1 (2009-07-14)

    Setting $BYPASS_CONFIRM in the WebLogin configuration now also
    suppresses the confirmation page after username/password login
    provided that the browser supports HTTP/1.1 (and the web server tells
    the WebLogin script that in the form Apache does).

    Setting $BYPASS_CONFIRM to the special value "id" in the WebLogin
    configuration suppresses the confirmation page only if the WebAuth
    Application Server requests an id token (in other words, only asks for
    the user's identity).  If it instead requests a proxy token, which
    would allow it to later ask for delegated user credentials, the
    confirmation page is still displayed.

    Add a new WebLogin configuration variable $TOKEN_ACL.  If set to the
    path of the token.acl file used by the WebKDC, and if the WebAuth
    Application Server requests a proxy token, the list of credentials the
    WAS may request is provided to the confirmation page template for
    display to the user.  See doc/weblogin-config for more information.

    WebLogin now sets and updates its cookies after successful
    authentication even if the confirmation screen is bypassed.  This
    primarily affects the update of the expiration time of the REMOTE_USER
    cookie.

    Handle err_confirm in the error.tmpl sample template and document this
    in doc/weblogin-config.  This error is returned when redisplaying the
    confirmation page after a change in the REMOTE_USER cookie.

    Fix a coding error in login.fcgi when redisplaying the confirmation
    page fails.  Thanks to pod for the report.

    Fix an off-by-one error in error code to error string mapping in
    WebKDC::WebKDCException that resulted in incorrect error names in
    WebLogin error messages.  Thanks to pod for the report.

    The WebLogin scripts and templates are now installed by default under
    /usr/local/share/weblogin.  This can be modified with the --prefix or
    --datadir options to configure.

    There is no longer an install-tests target; instead, to install the
    test suite, copy the directories under tests/mod_webauth recursively.
    This will be replaced by a better test suite mechanism in a future
    version of WebAuth.

    Update the mod_webauth documentation to reflect that separate WebAuth
    servers in the same load-balanced pool can use separate keytabs.  Only
    the keyring needs to be shared between systems.

    Improved the comments in the provided sample configuration files.

    Update the INSTALL documentation for obtaining keytabs for Stanford
    users to reference wallet instead of leland_srvtab.

WebAuth 3.6.0 (2008-03-22)

    Allocate all note keys and values in the top-most request pool in
    mod_webauth, avoiding problems with prematurely freed internal data
    structures.  This fixes problems with checking access permissions of
    subdirectories in mod_autoindex and may have fixed problems elsewhere.
    Thanks to Ian Ward Comfort for the patch.

    Add the WebKdcLocalRealms configuration option to mod_webkdc, which
    specifies the transformation behavior for authenticated identities.
    The default is "local", which runs krb5_aname_to_localname and uses
    the result as the authenticated identity (matching previous behavior).
    Setting it to "none" always keeps the fully-qualified Kerberos
    principal as the authenticated identity, and setting it to a list of
    realms strips the realm if it matches one of the listed realms and
    uses the fully-qualified Kerberos principal otherwise.  Thanks to
    Dmitri Priimak for the patch.

    Add the WebKdcPermittedRealms configuration option to mod_webkdc.  If
    set, only Kerberos principals in the listed realms will be able to
    obtain authentication tokens from the WebKDC.  This allows sites with
    Kerberos cross-realm trust to prevent users in foreign realms from
    obtaining WebAuth credentials that satisfy "require valid-user".
    Thanks to Dmitri Priimak for the patch.

    Add an additional check to webkdcProxyTokenRequest processing in
    mod_webkdc to ensure that the Kerberos authenticator and the included
    Kerberos TGT are for the same principal.

    The WebLogin login.tmpl template may be called with err_rejected set
    if the authenticating principal is rejected by the WebKDC.  Login
    templates should be modified to handle this variable.

    Add a new error to the WebKDC protocol, 18, indicating that the WebKDC
    did not permit that user to authenticate.  This error is returned when
    WebKdcPermittedRealms is set and the realm of the authenticating
    principal isn't included.  Add support for the new error in the
    WebLogin code, setting the template variable err_rejected.  Based on
    work by Dmitri Priimak.

    libwebauth provides a new webauth_krb5_get_realm function, which
    returns the realm of the current authenticated principal.

    The libwebauth webauth_krb5_get_principal function takes as its third
    argument, instead of a flag, an enum indicating what sort of
    canonicalization to perform.  Accepted values are WA_KRB5_CANON_LOCAL
    (to call krb5_aname_to_localname), WA_KRB5_CANON_STRIP (to strip any
    realm), and WA_KRB5_CANON_NONE (to return the fully-qualified
    principal).

    In the WebLogin script, work around a bug in the CGI module that
    causes it to misparse and die on WebLogin URLs that contain two
    slashes and two plus signs.

    WebLogin now supports delegated credentials, allowing browsers that
    support credential delegation via SPNEGO to still get single sign-on
    even to services that require proxy credentials or krb5
    authenticators.  See doc/install-spnego for configuration details.
    Based on work by Joachim Keltsch.

    WebLogin now supports a new configuration variable, $DEFAULT_REALM.
    If set, WebLogin will append @ and $DEFAULT_REALM to usernames that do
    not contain @ before passing them to the WebKDC.  This is primarily
    useful if principals should be authenticated in a different Kerberos
    realm than the default realm of the WebKDC.

    WebLogin now supports a new configuration file, $BYPASS_CONFIRM.  If
    set, the confirmation page will only be displayed if required by the
    HTTP protocol after a POST of the login form.  Otherwise, the user
    will be silently redirected to the destination site.

    Add support for a map_username function defined in the WebLogin config
    file.  If defined, this function will be called to map the
    user-supplied username to a Kerberos principal for authentication.

    Add support for a record_login function defined in the WebLogin config
    file.  If defined, this function will be called after any successful
    authentication.

    Many of the REMOTE_USER configuration variables have been renamed for
    consistency.  The old names are still supported for backward
    compatibility.  $REALM has been deprecated in favor of setting
    @REMUSER_REALMS to a list with a single value.

    Escape Mac OS X compiler flags for apxs, fixing build issues on Mac OS
    X 10.5.

WebAuth 3.5.5 (2008-01-14)

    Check for browser cookies on the first page visit to WebLogin via a
    redirect and show an error immediately if the user doesn't have
    cookies enabled.  This works correctly in the presence of Apache
    authentication.  Thanks to Joachim Keltsch for the patch.

    There is a new template variable, err_cookies_disabled, for the error
    template, indicating that the user doesn't have cookies enabled.  Old
    templates are supported but won't offer as nice of an error message.
    The err_cookies parameter to the login template is no longer used.

    Fix memory allocation in mod_webauthldap for the Kerberos ticket cache
    environment variable to use persistant rather than pool memory.  Fixes
    occasional segfaults in mod_php.

    Improve extraction of return URLs for user-friendly display when doing
    authentication for a Shibboleth IdP.  Thanks, Robert Basch.

    Show the correct pretty Shibboleth return URL when redisplaying the
    confirmation page.  Thanks, Robert Basch.

    Mark the test cookie secure to match other cookies so that we're
    testing what we're using.

    Use Javascript in the default login template to set focus to the
    username entry box.

WebAuth 3.5.4 (2007-04-24)

    Add a configuration option to WebLogin to attempt to decode return
    URLs pointing to a Shibboleth IdP and display on the confirmation page
    the final destination instead of the intermediate IdP.

    For pages that the browser should reload each time (WebAuthDoLogout or
    WebAuthDontCache), also always set the content modification time to
    now.  Otherwise, the browser may check the last modification time on
    the page and then serve its cached copy, ignoring any new Cookie
    headers from the server (such as cookie clearing from a logout page).

    For WebAuthDoLogout, WebAuthDontCache, and all WebLogin pages, set
    Cache-Control: no-store as well as no-cache.  no-store wasn't really
    intended for this purpose but preventing the browser from keeping a
    local copy is more likely to force the behavior we want.  (This is
    probably not necessary given the above change, but shouldn't hurt.)

    Properly merge configuration settings in mod_webauthldap.  This will
    correct problems with WebAuthLdapAuthrule, WebAuthLdapFilter, and
    WebAuthLdapPort configuration options not being honored inside virtual
    hosts.  Thanks to Wadud Miah for the bug report.

    Refresh the REMOTE_USER configuration cookie on each WebLogin page
    visit so that it won't expire if the user is using WebLogin
    regularly.

    Document the cookies used by the WebLogin service.

    Read ticket defaults from krb5.conf properly when built with Heimdal.

    Fix configure logic and Kerberos library analysis on systems with
    multiple versions of Kerberos installed.

    Escape -R linker flags from apxs, which doesn't understand them.
    Patch from Robert A. Basch.

WebAuth 3.5.3 (2006-09-12)

    Add the connection IP address and, for WebLogin logins, the client IP
    address to the WebKDC to the WebKDC log messages whenever processing
    XML requests.

    Document the log messages from the WebKDC in the mod_webkdc manual.

    Initial port to Apache 2.2.  Thanks to Jim Rodgers for the patch.

    Turn off debug-level logging in the WebLogin login.fcgi script by
    default.  The REMOTE_USER code now seems to be stable and working
    correctly and the extra verbose logging is not needed.

    Remove extraneous newlines from the messages logged by the mod_webauth
    module.

WebAuth 3.5.2 (2006-07-13)

    SECURITY: Modify the default templates to add ESCAPE=HTML when
    inserting the values of variables.  Without telling HTML::Template to
    escape values in this fashion, a cross-site scripting attack is
    possible with at least the username field of the login form.  Any site
    using customized templates should make the equivalent change to their
    templates.

    Set Pragma: no-cache and Cache-Control: no-cache in the HTTP headers
    of all responses from the WebLogin scripts.  This is particularly
    important for the logout script, since otherwise browsers may cache
    the logout page and not actually be logged out.

    Don't ever redirect the user to the URL that attempts Apache
    authentication if they've already submitted the login form, even if
    they didn't supply a username or password.  Once the user reaches the
    login page, the page flow should keep them there until they log in
    with username and password.

WebAuth 3.5.1 (2006-06-20)

    Allow the submit button on the login page to return any value rather
    than requiring it have the value "Login" so that the template can be
    more easily translated.  Instead, the login form must include the tag:

        <input type="hidden" name="login" value="yes">

    The form for attempting Apache remote-user authentication should not
    contain this tag.  Existing login.tmpl files must be updated
    accordingly when upgrading to this version of the WebLogin server.

    In the weblogin confirmation page, the variable remuser is now set to
    1 if the user has a cookie indicating they want to try REMOTE_USER and
    is not set otherwise.  This is a change from the previous behavior
    where it was set to either the string "checked" or the empty string.
    Templates using this variable will require modification.  This change
    was made so that the WebLogin scripts don't assume a particular UI
    presentation.

    Add an err_forced template variable for the login.tmpl file that
    indicates the user had a single sign-on configuration (either an
    existing cookie or a request to do REMUSER), but the authenticating
    web site requires username/password authentication.  Existing
    login.tmpl files must be updated to include a reference to this
    variable (even if not otherwise used).

    Add the @REALMS configuration option to the WebLogin configuration
    file, for use with Apache authentication where the resulting
    REMOTE_USER value may be in one of several realms and each realm
    should be treated identically.

    Modify the default login template to show a single error message if
    the user provided neither username nor password rather than showing
    the missing username and missing password errors one after the other.

    Fix decoding of time_t values in tokens on 64-bit platforms, a bug
    which usually manifested itself while reading keyrings.  Thanks to pod
    for the analysis.

    Properly check for apxs in configure so that an apxs under the
    provided Apache root will be found.  Thanks to Marco Wise for the
    debugging.

WebAuth 3.5.0 (2006-03-20)

    Rename the template variables used by the weblogin templates to be
    a bit more consistent and add an error variable to the login template
    that is set whenever there was any error.  Existing weblogin templates
    will require modifications.  See doc/weblogin-config for the new
    configuration and customization documentation.

    Sometimes an Apache authentication mechanism should only be attempted
    if the user explicitly requests it since it may fail in a way that
    doesn't allow weblogin to proceed.  SPNEGO is an example, since it has
    bad behavior with some browsers.  Implement weblogin script support
    for the required more complex page flow and additional template
    variables.

    Document in detail how to configure the weblogin front-end, including
    all of the template variables used and the configuration variables
    that can be set in /etc/webkdc/webkdc.conf.

    Document in detail the page flow for the weblogin script and the
    variables it uses when rendering page templates.

    WebAuthExtraRedirect is now the default.  If you don't want this
    behavior, you now need to turn it off explicitly in the Apache
    configuration.

    WebAuthExtraRedirect is now accepted at the server and virtual host
    level as well as in <Directory> and .htaccess files.

    In the WebKDC installation instructions, stop recommending that the
    WebkDC /webkdc-service URL run on a different port than the regular
    SSL port.  There's no reason why it and the weblogin service can't
    both run on the regular SSL port.

    Preliminary port to Heimdal 0.6 (0.7 was previously supported).  This
    has not yet been well-tested.

    Recommend installing an SSL certificate before testing in INSTALL,
    since otherwise WebAuth would be unhappy.  Combine a few steps
    together and also recommend WebAuthSSLRedirect on.

    Change WebAuthSSLRedirect to on in the recommended and default
    configuration files, since it works with the standard installation
    instructions.

WebAuth 3.4.2 (2006-02-17)

    Don't try to build the modules with -z defs.  If it actually works, it
    breaks the build, since Apache modules refer to symbols that are only
    in httpd, not in any linked library.

    Transform -pthread or -pthreads in the Kerberos compiler flags into
    something that apxs can handle.  This is needed for some builds of
    Heimdal.

    Add another fix for finding et/com_err.h on Red Hat, this time for
    mod_webauthldap.

    Search for apxs2 in the path before apxs.  WebAuth requires Apache
    2.x, so if apxs2 is available, it's more likely the right thing to use
    than apxs.  This change allows the WebAuth build to find apxs properly
    on Debian without extra configure flags.

    Document the Kerberos ticket encoding for WebAuth tokens in the
    protocol specification.

WebAuth 3.4.1 (2006-02-06)

    Revert the change in 3.4.0 to not strip WebAuth data from the URLs for
    unprotected URLs since it didn't work with .htaccess files.

    Document the WebAuthStripURL directive as a partial replacement for
    the problem the reverted change was supposed to solve.  This directive
    has always been supported but it was previously undocumented and not
    guaranteed to remain.

    Port to Heimdal.  The Kerberos implementation dependencies are all
    inside libwebauth, which can now be built with either MIT Kerberos or
    Heimdal.  Mixed environments with some Heimdal-based WebAuth modules
    and some MIT-based modules should work correctly.

    Avoid deprecated OpenLDAP interfaces whose prototypes are unavailable
    by default in OpenLDAP 2.3.

    Support et/com_err.h as well as com_err.h for portability to Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux 4 and possibly other newer Red Hat-based Linux
    systems.

WebAuth 3.4.0 (2006-01-24)

    Add support to the weblogin server and WebKDC module to trust an
    authentication identity asserted by Apache.  This allows use of any
    authentication type that Apache supports as WebAuth authentication, in
    particular SPNEGO/GSSAPI.

    Allow login.fcgi to be used as the target of an ErrorDocument Apache
    directive and read the query parameters from the redirect environment
    variable.  This lets one use SPNEGO as the default and fall back on
    password authentication if it fails.  To support this feature, there
    is an additional template variable for the login template,
    script_name, that should be used as the action of the login form.

    The WebAuth module no longer strips WebAuth data (WEBAUTHR and
    WEBAUTHS) from the internal URL for requests to URLs not protected by
    WebAuth.  This way, Apache with mod_webauth loaded will not interfere
    with applications that wish to implement the WebAuth protocol
    themselves.  Thanks to Mats Henrikson for the report.

    Rewrite the WebAuth protocol documentation in RFC 2629 XML.  In the
    process, edited it extensively for consistency of terminology, updated
    it in a few places, and clarified the wording.

    Better Kerberos library checks, including support for MIT Kerberos 1.4
    and use of krb5-config where appropriate.

    Add --enable-reduced-depends to configure to request the minimal
    possible shared library dependencies be encoded at run-time.  This is
    for systems that properly implement transitive shared library
    dependencies, in order to minimize shared library conflicts introduced
    by SONAME changes and upgrades (mainly for Linux distribution
    packagers).

    The public interface for the libwebauth library now uses char *
    uniformly instead of unsigned char *, since using the latter is too
    annoying and causes too many compiler warnings.

    Remove more vestiges of S/Ident support.  mod_webkdc will no longer
    recognize the old Apache S/Ident directives.

    Ask the linker to be sure that all external references are defined
    when linking the Apache modules on Linux.

    Lots of general documentation updates for clarity and style.

WebAuth 3.3.0 (2005-10-04)

    All WebKDC support for S/Ident removed.  The S/Ident protocol is
    inherently vulnerable to an active man-in-the-middle attack that is
    particularly severe for WebAuth, since S/Ident authentication is done
    by a single server and WebAuth users regularly visit that server.
    Exploiting this protocol flaw would allow an attacker to capture a
    single sign-on cookie and then impersonate the user to all WebAuth
    sites in that domain.

    Add WebAuthLdapSeparator to specify the separator for multivalued
    attributes.  When set in the server configuration, all values of a
    multivalued attribute are concatenated together, separated by that
    separator, and put into the base WEBAUTH_LDAP_* environment variable
    (rather than only the first one).

    Clean up, expand, and improve the module documentation for
    mod_webauthldap.

    Add symbol versioning for libwebauth on Linux.  Symbol versioning is
    not supported on other platforms (at least yet).

WebAuth 3.2.8 (2005-06-03)

    mod_webauth now treats empty keyrings the same as keyrings that cannot
    be read, which will force the creation of a new keyring if auto-update
    is turned on.

    The mod_webkdc manual has been expanded and improved, fixing several
    documentation bugs (including a badly incorrect wa_keyring gc
    example).

WebAuth 3.2.7 (2005-04-23)

    Update libtool to 1.5.6 (the Debian version) to support proper shared
    library builds on Linux MIPS.

    In the weblogin login script, check to be sure the service token is
    set as well as the request token to avoid weird error messages from
    the WebKDC module later on.

WebAuth 3.2.6 (2005-04-19)

    Rename the Perl bindings from WebAuth3 to WebAuth to match the name of
    the shared library.

WebAuth 3.2.5 (2005-04-14)

    Downgrade most of the messages from mod_webauthldap to info from
    notice, including the messages about authorization.  Downgrade the
    message about failed authorization from warning to notice.  This seems
    more consistent with the Apache documentation of log levels.

WebAuth 3.2.4 (2004-08-25)

    In the weblogin script, only check for cookies when the user is not
    using S/Ident to authenticate.  This fixes the problem with users
    seeing the login page even if S/Ident is enabled, and then being
    allowed to proceed with S/Ident authentication after a simple page
    reload.

    Clean up and comment the weblogin login and logout scripts and
    remove Perl module uses that are no longer needed.

    Fix the error reporting in the WebKDC module when S/Ident requests
    fail.  Previously, the actual error would never be reported.

WebAuth 3.2.3 (2004-06-23)

    Long delays for some clients after redirects from mod_webauth should
    improve.  The redirect was being returned without a body but also
    without a Content-Length, forcing clients supporting keep-alive to
    wait for a timeout.  This may (but hopefully won't) cause more looping
    problems.

    The WebKDC package now looks at /etc/webkdc/webkdc.conf and paths can
    be overridden by modifying that file.

    Replace the sample WebLogin server templates with generic templates
    that don't use any Stanford-copyrighted logos or design.

    Install a man page for wa_keyring and the header file for the webauth
    library.

WebAuth 3.2.2 (2004-03-02)

    Add new WebAuthSSLReturn directive. If an unauth'd user shows up
    via http at a webauth-protected page and gets redirected to weblogin,
    the return URL will be https.

    Fix a bug in libwebauth that prevented wa_keyring from adding keys to
    an empty keyring file.

    Add a new mod-config.h for Autoconf results that we want to use in
    module builds, and use this to fix compatibility in mod_webauthldap
    for older versions of the Kerberos libraries and remove code to add
    Autoconf results to the compile command line for mod_webkdc builds.

    Fix various compilation problems with Sun cc, including signed vs.
    unsigned char mismatches and C++-style comments.

    Fix invalid HTML in the templates for the weblogin pages.

    Include the right compiler flags to find the extra Kerberos libraries
    we need when probing for S/Ident, if they're in a non-standard
    location that isn't the same as the S/Ident location.

    Support older 1.2.x Kerberos libraries in mod_webauthldap.

    Fix some portability issues with non-GNU make.

WebAuth 3.2.1 (2003-09-10)

    When AuthType is StanfordAuth, don't default to WebAuthDontCache.
    This appears to break IE 6.0 downloads.

    Add WebAuthPostReturnURL directive to allow an app to deal with 
    handling a POST that didn't have authentication.

    When operating in legacy mode, only check LDAP for a group if it
    contains a colon.  Otherwise, defer to Apache's normal group handling.
    This fixes handling of user-defined groups in .htaccess files when
    backward compatibility is turned on.

    When a call to the LDAP server fails, try binding again and retrying
    the call before actually failing.  The connection may have timed out
    or something else may have temporarily gone wrong.  This will help
    with error messages about the LDAP server not being available.

    Fix the setting of the interactive flag on S/Ident queries in the
    WebKDC.

    Correct handling of successful S/Ident calls returning errors in
    mod_webkdc when debugging is turned off.

WebAuth 3.2.0 (2003-08-07)

    Add S/Ident support to weblogin and the WebKDC.

    Add a preliminary port to Windows.  See windows/BUILD.txt for more
    information.

    Fix a bug when handling sub-requests (like in mod_autoindex).  This
    could have caused authentication information to be incorrect in pages
    generated by fancy indexing.

    Add new WebKDC commands webkdcProxyToken and webkdcProxyTokenInfo.

    Add three new functions to libwebauth: webauth_krb5_init_via_cache
    and webauth_krb5_{mk,rd}_req_with_data.

    Remove the WebAuthProxyHeaders directive.  Add new documentation to
    mod_webauth.xml that recommends people use mod_headers instead.  See
    "Using WebAuth with Proxy Servers" in that document.

    Modify WebAuthDontCache so it also adds "Pragma: no-cache" and
    "Cache-Control: no-cache" headers in addition to the "Expires" header.

    Modify WebAuthDoLogout so that it enables WebAuthDontCache
    automatically.  (If the logout page was cached, second and subsequent
    visits wouldn't remove the login cookie correctly.)

    When returning redirects, make sure to set r->header_only so there
    is no extra content generated by Apache.  Also set the same Expires,
    Pragma, and Cache-Control headers that WebAuthDontCache sets.  This
    will hopefully work around the bugs that occur when caching redirects
    in some browsers.

    Increased robustness of the privgroup handling in mod_webauthldap when
    the LDAP query returns multiple entries.  Errors when looking for
    attributes in one entry no longer prevent checking for attributes in
    additional entries.

    The WebLogin test cookie is now a session cookie like the WebAuth
    cookie, so we test what we use, and so it works correctly with
    browsers that disable non-session cookies.

    Build portability fix for Tru64 and other platforms whose sed cannot
    handle multiline patterns.

    Remove extra logging from mod_webauth/webkdc.c, and moved other
    extraneous logging so it's only logged at a level of APLOG_DEBUG when
    WebAuthDebug is turned on.

WebAuth 3.1.2 (2003-05-29)

    Multiple bugs were fixed in mod_webauthldap, it now supports multiple
    virtualhosts, and it now has better memory utilization and thread
    safety improvements.

    Correctly construct the return URL for reverse proxies.

    Don't try to decode a zero length service token cache file.  Log a
    warning and return NULL as if there were no file.

    Ported to Solaris 7 with gcc 2.95.  Basic WebAuth (but not LDAP)
    ported to AIX 4.3.

    Modify wa_keyring to not use getopt (not available on windows), and
    change strftime format from %T to %H:%M:%S (%T also not available on
    windows strftime).

WebAuth 3.1.1 (2003-05-08)

    Fix HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT in src/webkdc/logout.fcgi script by changing
    the path to relative instead of absolute.

WebAuth 3.1.0 (2003-05-01)

    Add a new Apache module, mod_webauthldap, for LDAP directory
    information lookups via Kerberos v5 GSS-API binds.  This module
    provides the same directory lookup capability as older versions of
    WebAuth, but does so against OpenLDAP servers, via Kerberos v5
    authentication, and with considerably more flexible support for what
    attributes to query. See the mod_webauthldap manual for more details.

    Add WebAuthSSLRedirect and WebAuthSSLRedirectPort directives so that
    users can be redirected from http to https when accessing a
    WebAuth-protected resource.

    Add a WebAuthAuthType directive to help people transition to
    mod_webauth from older versions.  This directive allows you to specify
    an additional AuthType name that will be treated the same as WebAuth.
    If this directive is set to StanfordAuth, it will also set two extra
    environment variables: SU_AUTH_USER and SU_AUTH_AGE (these were set by
    WebAuth 2.5).

    Add more backward compatibility support for WebAuth 2.5 by allowing
    the following directives to appear in .htaccess files:

    StanfordAuthConfirmMsg  -> ignored

    StanfordAuthDoConfirm   -> warns to error_log if set to on

    StanfordAuthDontCache   -> maps to WebAuthDontCache. If AuthType
                               is set to StanfordAuth, defaults to 1.

    StanfordAuthForceReload -> maps to WebAuthExtraRedirect

    StanfordAuthLife        -> maps to WebAuthAppTokenLifetime and enables
                               WebAuthForceLogin

    StanfordAuthReturnURL   -> maps to WebAuthReturnURL

    StanfordAuthGroups      -> unsupported, if specified access is denied

    Allow these directives to be present in .htaccess files (they were
    previously only allowed in <Directory>/<Location> directives):

        WebAuthExtraRedirect
        WebAuthReturnURL
        WebAuthLoginCanceledURL
        WebAuthVarPrefix

    This is in partial support of backward compatibility.

    Add WebAuthProxyHeaders directive to pass WebAuth information to a
    proxied server.  See the WebAuth module documentation for more
    information.

    Add WebAuthWebKdcSSLCertCheck directive to enable/disable checking of
    the WebKDC SSL certificate.  Defaults to "on" and should only be
    turned off for debugging/testing purposes.

    Add new WebAuthDontCache directive, which signals a browser not to
    cache those web pages.  Defaults to 0 (allow documents to be cached).

    Modify the WebAuthKeytab and WebKdcKeytab directives so you can
    optionally specify which principal to use with the specified keytab,
    instead of using the first principal found.  This is useful if the
    keytab contains multiple keys.

    Remove the service token cache on restarts, so that a restart will
    clear up any inconsistencies between the server and the WebKDC.

    Have the WebKDC re-read the token ACL file if its mtime changes.

    Clean up environment variable setting.  Set environment variables
    (r->subprocess_env) in check_user_id hook instead of waiting until
    fixups hook to make them more accessible to other hooks/modules.

    Add --with-apxs configure option to set the path to apxs independently
    from the path to the Apache installation.  This was needed in order to
    easily build WebAuth on Linux distributions that install Apache
    following the Linux Filesystem Standard.

    Fix several bugs in scrubbing WebAuth tokens from the URL.

    If we are proxying or the URI passed to the server in the HTTP request
    has a scheme, use it as the return URL instead of constructing one
    relative to the server.

    Restructure the mod_webauth code to define a pluggable credential
    interface, isolating all credential-related functions so that new
    credential types can easily be supported.

WebAuth 3.0.0 (2003-02-18)

    Initial public release of WebAuth v3.  This is a complete rewrite of
    the WebAuth system, sharing no common code with the previous release.
    It is now based on Apache 2.0, Kerberos v5, and a new infrastructure
    for managing authentication tokens.

    This is the initial release with basic authentication support and Perl
    bindings only.
