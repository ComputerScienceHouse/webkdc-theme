# Stanford Apache configuration example for WebAuth.  -*- apache -*-
#
# The following Apache configuration fragment is a sample minimal
# configuration for a WebAuth server at Stanford University, similar to the
# one given in INSTALL but with comments explaining each step of what's going
# on.
#
# Debian and Ubuntu users should install the packages that come with the
# operating system and follow the configuration instructions in
# /usr/share/doc/libapache2-webauth/README.Debian.gz.

# Each WebAuth server has to talk to a central authentication server called
# the WebKDC, both to send users to the login server and to be able to
# interpret the tokens that it returns.  Some of the directives below are
# needed to facilitate that behind-the-scenes communication.

# The WebAuth module is built as a dynamic module by default.  This loads it
# into Apache.
LoadModule webauth_module /usr/local/libexec/apache2/modules/mod_webauth.so

# Location of the server's private AES keys, used for communication with the
# WebKDC.  Generated and maintained automatically, so it must be writable by
# the Apache server process.
WebAuthKeyring conf/webauth/keyring

# Location of the server's Kerberos keytab.  You need to generate this file
# as part of the installation by using wallet.  For instructions and more
# information, see <http://www.stanford.edu/services/kerberos/sysadmin/>.
WebAuthKeytab conf/webauth/keytab

# Location of where the service tokens are kept.  These tokens are used to
# authenticate internal communication with the WebKDC.  This file has to be
# writable by the Apache server processes.
WebAuthServiceTokenCache conf/webauth/service_token_cache

# Where the user is redirected to enter a username and password.
WebAuthLoginURL https://weblogin.stanford.edu/login/

# URL used for behind-the-scenes communication with the WebKDC.
WebAuthWebKdcURL https://weblogin.stanford.edu/webkdc-service/

# The service name to use when communicating with the WebKDC.
WebAuthWebKdcPrincipal service/webkdc@stanford.edu

# Anyone who tries to access a WebAuth-protected page via HTTP rather than
# HTTPS will be redirected to HTTPS (but otherwise using the same URL).
WebAuthSSLRedirect on

# Uncomment this if you want to use "AuthType StanfordAuth" in your
# .htaccess files.  This will allow you to use both StanfordAuth and
# WebAuth with the AuthType directive.
#
# WebAuthAuthType StanfordAuth

# If you are having trouble getting WebAuth to run, you should turn on debug
# and also change your Apache LogLevel setting to debug.
#
# WebAuthDebug on

# If you are really have trouble getting WebAuth to run, you should turn on
# debug, and also enable the /webauth-status URL, then point your browser at
# it to check on the status of mod_webauth.  You should turn off the
# webauth-status URL when you are done.
#
#<Location /webauth-status>
#   SetHandler webauth
#   Order allow,deny
#   Allow from all
#</Location>

# Example of restricting a location to authenticated users only.  If
# uncommented, all URLs under /private/ would require WebAuth authentication
# to access.
#
#<Location /private/ >
#    AuthType WebAuth
#    Require valid-user
#</Location>

# Example of a logout page for a particular application.  (Note that even if
# the user goes to this page, they will still have their site-wide single
# sign-on cookie, so they will not be completely logged out.  This will only
# destroy their credentials for that particular application.)  There should
# also be a web page that this URL corresponds to; WebAuth will not generate
# one internally.
#
# You may want to include on this web page a link to:
#
#     <https://weblogin.stanford.edu/logout>
#
# which will destroy their site-wide single sign-on cookie as well if they
# follow the link.
#
#<Location /logout/ >
#    AllowOverride All
#    WebAuthDoLogout on
#</Location>
