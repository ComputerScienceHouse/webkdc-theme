libapache2-webauth (3.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  As of this release, the WebAuth module is built for Apache 2.2 rather
  than Apache 2.0.  Please note that Apache 2.2 moved authentication and
  authorization functionality out of Apache into modules that may not be
  enabled by default.  In particular, directives of the form:

      Require valid-user
      Require user <username>

  will not work unless mod_authz_user is enabled.  To do this, run:

      a2enmod authz_user

  as root.  You do not need to enable this module if you never use
  directives of that type (if, for instance, you only use Require
  privgroup directives), but note that the WebAuth tests expect this
  functionality to be available.
