Upstream Author(s):

  The WebAuth v3 protocol and core implementation was written by Roland
  Schemers, based on design documents by the entire Stanford WebAuth team
  (with considerable work by Tim Torgenrud and Booker Bense) and based in
  part on the functionality of WebAuth v2.5, written and maintained by a
  cast of dozens over the years but most notably Jeff Lewis, Anton
  Ushakov, and Jeanmarie Lucker.

  The mod_webauthldap module was written by Anton Ushakov.

  The configuration and build system and WebAuth packaging was put
  together by Russ Allbery.  Huaqing Zheng provided builds of supporting
  packages and Jonathan Pilat helped greatly with testing.  Xueshan Feng
  oversaw the project.
