Upstream authors:

    The WebAuth v3 protocol and core implementation was written by Roland
    Schemers, based on design documents by the entire Stanford WebAuth
    team (with considerable work by Tim Torgenrud and Booker Bense) and
    based in part on the functionality of WebAuth v2.5, written and
    maintained by a cast of dozens over the years but most notably Jeff
    Lewis, Anton Ushakov, and Jeanmarie Lucker.

    The mod_webauthldap module was written by Anton Ushakov.

    The configuration and build system and WebAuth packaging was put
    together by Russ Allbery.  Huaqing Zheng provided builds of supporting
    packages and Jonathan Pilat helped greatly with testing.  Xueshan Feng
    oversaw the project.

    Thanks to pod for improvements, particularly to the WebKDC, to make it
    easier to package for a Linux distribution, for the initial Debian
    package build rules, and for generic WebKDC templates suitable for a
    new installation and for use as examples.
