webauth (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The weblogin template variables have changed significantly with this
  release, both by renaming existing ones and by adding new ones.  Please
  read /usr/share/doc/webauth-weblogin/weblogin-config.gz for detailed
  documentation for both the template variables and the webkdc.conf
  settings.
