WebAuth Tests for Debian
------------------------

To enable these tests, add the following to:

    /etc/apache2/conf.d/webauth-tests

or wherever you prefer to put local Apache configuration:

    Include /usr/share/webauth/conf/webauth-tests.conf
    Include /usr/share/webauth/conf/ldaptests.conf

    Alias /tests/ /usr/share/webauth/htdocs/tests/
    Alias /ldaptests/ /usr/share/webauth/htdocs/ldaptests/

and make sure that CGI scripts are enabled with:

    a2enmod cgi

Then reload the configuration with /etc/init.d/apache2 reload.  You can
then go to /tests/ and /ldaptests/ on your site to see the test suite.
You will also need to install and enable PHP to do the PHP test.

The LDAP tests are fairly Stanford-specific in that they use attributes
peculiar to Stanford's directory servers and privgroups specific to
Stanford, so you may need to copy ldaptests.conf to another file and
modify it to make it a better test for your site.

If you are not using the WebAuth LDAP module, you can just omit the two
lines referring to ldaptests.
