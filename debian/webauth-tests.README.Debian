WebAuth Tests for Debian
------------------------

To enable these tests, add the following to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf or
wherever you put local configuration:

    Include /usr/share/webauth/conf/webauth-tests.conf
    Include /usr/share/webauth/conf/ldaptests.conf

    Alias /tests/ /usr/share/webauth/htdocs/tests/
    Alias /ldaptests/ /usr/share/webauth/htdocs/ldaptests/

and make sure that CGI scripts are enabled with:

    a2enmod cgi

Then reload the configuration with /etc/init.d/apache2 reload.  You can
then go to /tests/ and /ldaptests/ on your site to see the test suite.

The LDAP tests are fairly Stanford-specific in that they use attributes
peculiar to Stanford's directory servers and privgroups specific to
Stanford, so you may need to modify ldaptests.conf to make it a better
test for your site.

If you are not using the WebAuth LDAP module, you can just omit the two
lines referring to ldaptests.
