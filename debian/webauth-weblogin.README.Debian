WebAuth Weblogin Server for Debian
----------------------------------

This package contains the central Weblogin server for a WebAuth
installation.  Only one server (or one pool of load-balanced servers) at a
given site need to run this package.  libapache2-webkdc should also be
installed on the same server as this package is running on.

This package comes with a very generic set of page templates, suitable for
getting started.  You will probably want to customize those templates for
your local site, and you should definitely customize the help.html web
page to contain contact information for your local help desk.  The generic
templates are installed in /usr/share/webauth/generic; you can just copy
that whole directory with cp -r to another directory and make whatever
changes you want.  Then, change the paths in the two Alias lines below to
point to your directory instead of the generic directory and change the
TEMPLATE_PATH in /etc/webkdc/webkdc.conf to point to the new path.

(You could then, if you wished, make a Debian package of your local
templates to make them easier to maintain.)

See:

    <http://webauthv3.stanford.edu/>

for more information about WebAuth, including copies of the module manuals
and places to contact to get help with the installation.


Installing the Weblogin Server
------------------------------

The Weblogin server is implemented as Perl CGI scripts.  In order to
finish the installation, you need to add Apache configuration directives
to send the login and logout URLs to these CGI scripts and to allow the
images and help page they refer to to be found.

Add the following configuration to a virtual host in:

    /etc/apache2/sites-available/weblogin

or wherever you put local Apache configuration:

    <Directory "/usr/share/weblogin">
        AllowOverride None
        Options +ExecCGI
        SSLRequireSSL
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
    ScriptAlias /login "/usr/share/weblogin/login.fcgi"
    ScriptAlias /logout "/usr/share/weblogin/logout.fcgi"

    Alias /help.html "/usr/share/weblogin/generic/help.html"
    Alias /images/ "/usr/share/weblogin/generic/images/"

(If you put this in sites-available, you then need to enable the site with
a2ensite.)

The ScriptAlias and Alias directives can, of course, be changed if you
want the Weblogin server to live at a different URL (although note that
the default templates expect /help.html and /images to work and may need
to be modified otherwise).

If you used something other than /webkdc-service as the URL to the WebKDC,
you will need to modify the $URL setting in /etc/webkdc/webkdc.conf to
point to the appropriate URL on localhost that the WebKDC is listening to.

Because the Weblogin server accepts Kerberos passwords from end-users, it
must only be available over SSL.  The SSLRequireSSL above makes sure that
users only use SSL to contact the server, but you may also want to put the
above in a virtual host specifically for SSL and set up a separate non-SSL
virtual host that redirects all accesses to the SSL URL.

Now, reload Apache's configuration file with apache2ctl graceful.  After
you've tested and everything is working, you will probably want to
customize the templates as described above.


Site Documentation
------------------

After you have configured both this server and the WebKDC, following the
instructions in /usr/share/doc/libapache2-webkdc/README.Debian, you should
document the way WebAuth is configured at your site for other users who
are installing the WebAuth modules on individual web servers.  I recommend
putting up a web page that contains the following information:

 * The configuration needed for libapache2-webauth (or any other
   installation of WebAuth, regardless of platform, at your site).  Users
   who are installing WebAuth servers need to know the URL to the WebKDC
   service, the URL to the Weblogin server, and the Kerberos principal
   used by the WebKDC, choices that you had to make while installing.

   I recommend using:

        WebAuthLoginURL https://weblogin.example.com/login
        WebAuthWebKdcURL https://weblogin.example.com/webkdc-service
        WebAuthWebKdcPrincipal service/webkdc@example.com

   where example.com is your domain.  But as long as you configure this
   package and libapache2-webkdc consistently, you can use whatever URLs
   and Kerberos principals you want.

 * The naming convention for WebAuth Kerberos principals for individual
   web servers.  This needs to match the configuration that you put into
   token.acl when configuring the WebKDC.

 * How to download or otherwise obtain a Kerberos keytab at your site,
   when someone is installing a new server.  This will depend on how your
   Kerberos realm is maintained.

You will also want to modify the templates for the Weblogin server as
mentioned above to include images, pointers, and help appropriate to your
local site.


Using FastCGI
-------------

The Weblogin scripts are written so that they can use FastCGI, but don't
require it.  FastCGI is, unfortunately, under a non-free license, so this
is not the default.

If you want to use these scripts with FastCGI, you will need to install
the Apache 2.x modules for FastCGI, which are not bundled with Debian.
You can obtain them from <http://www.fastcgi.com/>.  Once the module is
installed, you need to add this line to load the module:

    LoadModule fastcgi_module modules/mod_fastcgi.so

and then, to the <Directory> block in the installation instructions above,
add the line:

    AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi

After you restart Apache with apache2ctl graceful, the Weblogin scripts
should run under FastCGI.
