/*
 * WebAuth token manipulation functions.
 *
 * These interfaces parse, unparse, and otherwise manipulate WebAuth tokens.
 * Tokens in WebAuth have two canonical representations: an encrypted wire
 * format, which is encrypted in some key (except for the key hint) and
 * base64-encoded, and a decrypted struct representation that's used
 * internally by WebAuth code.  Each token type has a corresponding encode and
 * decode function to convert between those two representations.
