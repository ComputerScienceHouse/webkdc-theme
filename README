DESCRIPTION

  WebAuth is a comprehensive system for authenticating web users, built on
  top of Apache 2.0.  It relies on a login server (the WebKDC) to which
  users are redirected at their first attempt to access a protected web
  site, uses AES-encrypted chunks of data called tokens which can be sent
  either in URLs or in cookies and are used to communicate between the
  login server and each participating web server, and implements a
  protocol able to use whichever initial user authentication mechanism is
  convenient to establish the user's identity.  Once the user has logged
  in to the login server, their identity is carried in a cookie set by
  that login server and they will not again need to enter their password
  until their credentials expire, even if they visit multiple different
  protected web sites.

  At present, WebAuth relies on Kerberos v5 to establish the user's
  identity and only that authentication mechanism is implemented by the
  current release, but the protocol should be sufficiently general to
  allow for other methods to be added.

  This is a substantial reworking of the previous Stanford WebAuth system,
  which was based primarily around the S/Ident protocol for user
  authentication but supported a fallback to a web login server and used
  domain-wide cookies to pass that authentication information to
  individual web servers.  This implementation was heavily inspired by
  that previous work but shares no common code, only uses cookies scoped
  to individual systems, and is now built primarily around the login
  server model with "web single sign-on" (single sign-on that works for
  all authenticated web sites within an authentication realm, but which
  does not necessarily tie into desktop single sign-on systems).

  For more information on the Stanford WebAuth project, see:

      <http://webauthv3.stanford.edu/>

  WebAuth also provides a second module that can do LDAP directory lookups
  using Kerberos v5 GSS-API authentication and use the result to authorize
  web clients by privilege groups or provide directory information to web
  applications in environment variables.

  Future releases of this software will also support obtaining of
  credentials on behalf of the user by trusted application servers,
  allowing cleaner implementation of portal-style applications.


REQUIREMENTS

  WebAuth requires the following additional packages:

      Apache 2.0.43 or later (2.0.45 or later recommended)
      OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later
      MIT Kerberos v5 1.2.x or later (1.2.8 or later recommended)
      cURL (tested with 7.10.2)

  LDAP support also requires:

      Cyrus SASL 2.x (tested with 2.1.13)
      OpenLDAP 2.x (tested with 2.1.17)

  Apache 2.0 must be built with --enable-ssl and --enable-so.  WebAuth
  uses apxs to build its Apache modules.

  The WebAuth Perl bindings, which at present are always built, have only
  been tested with Perl 5.6.1, although they may work with earlier
  versions of Perl.

  For the end user, WebAuth requires that the user's browser be able to
  handle cookies of moderate length (up to 1KB) and URLs of a similar
  length.  Cookies must be enabled for the systems that use WebAuth
  authentication.  All communication with WebAuth servers is required to
  be over SSL/TLS to protect the user's credentials.  No other special
  browser capabilities are required.

  WebAuth is written in C and requires a C compiler and a standard make
  program to build.  It does not (at least intentionally) use any special
  make features.

  WebAuth is primarily tested with GCC on Solaris 8 and Linux (glibc 2.2).
  Other Unix platforms that support Apache 2.0 should also work, but have
  not been tested.  Some amount of porting may be required.  WebAuth does
  use libtool to try to build shared libraries portably.


SUPPORT

  New WebAuth releases are announced via the low-volume webauth-announce
  mailing list.  To subscribe, send mail to majordomo@lists.stanford.edu
  with:

      subscribe webauth-announce

  in the body of the message.

  There is also a separate mailing list for general discussion and
  requests for help, which is also read by members of the WebAuth project
  team.  To subscribe, send mail to majordomo@lists.stanford.edu with:

      subscribe webauth-info

  in the body of the message.  Stanford users may instead read and post to
  the newsgroup su.computers.webauth, which is bidirectionally gatewayed
  to webauth-info.  The newsgroup additionally gets all messages to
  webauth-announce as well.

  For Stanford affiliates, the WebAuth modules are a supported product of
  the ITSS Infrastructure Services team.  You can report problems or
  request help with WebAuth by submitting a HelpSU ticket at:

      <http://helpsu.stanford.edu/>

  Please note that we do *not* support Apache 2.0, and we cannot help you
  set up a web server.  We can help you configure WebAuth and may provide
  a prebuilt Apache 2.0 server for your platform for convenience, but
  general web server problems unrelated to WebAuth are outside the scope
  of what we can help with.

  For non-Stanford users, please instead subscribe to webauth-info and ask
  your question there.  We cannot provide any formal support for
  non-Stanford users, nor do we make any promises or committments related
  to this software.  Please feel free to use it on an as-is basis, and
  please do feel free to send us any patches or improvements that you wish
  to contribute and we will evaluate them for future releases.  Our
  primary focus is supporting the needs of Stanford University, however,
  and problems that don't affect Stanford's use of WebAuth will generally
  not be prioritized.

CREDITS

  The WebAuth v3 protocol and core implementation was written by Roland
  Schemers, based on design documents by the entire Stanford WebAuth team
  (with considerable work by Tim Torgenrud and Booker Bense) and based in
  part on the functionality of WebAuth v2.5, written and maintained by a
  cast of dozens over the years but most notably Jeff Lewis, Anton
  Ushakov, and Jeanmarie Lucker.

  The mod_webauthldap module was written by Anton Ushakov.

  The configuration and build system and WebAuth packaging was put
  together by Russ Allbery.  Huaqing Zheng provided builds of supporting
  packages and Jonathan Pilat helped greatly with testing.  Xueshan Feng
  oversaw the project.
