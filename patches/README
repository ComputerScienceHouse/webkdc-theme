This directory contains contributed patches to WebAuth that we've chosen
not to apply for some reason but don't want to lose.  It is not
distributed in releases and is kept only in Subversion for our internal
use in development.

When putting a patch in this directory, please make sure that it will
apply with patch -p1, explain what the patch is for in a preface to the
patch, state what version number the patch was made against, and note the
author of the patch.

Please name patches with dashes, not underscores, separating words and
without any unnecessary extensions like .diff or .patch.
